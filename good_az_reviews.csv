Casa Molina Del Norte,We've been coming here since I was a kid. The staff has watched me and now my kids grow up. They're personable and so nice. They're also very prompt with service. Yoli and frank are the absolute best! The food is amazing! I absolutely love their shredded beef burro and cheese crisp. I feel they have true authentic Mexican food.
Penca,Wow. That was incredible. Best lunch I've had in a month. Try their tacos - fish and veggie
Penca,"Street Tacos in Tucson all get their inspiration right here.  Best Black Beans and Cotija Cheese on the Planet.  If you come visit me, 100% chance I'm taking you here for the win."
Penca,"Last minute decision--quick reservation via Yelp. Seated immediately upon arrival. Our waitress, Emma, was great--friendly and helpful. The food (Pescado de la Casa--Sea Bass tonight and Chile Relleno) was delicious. The horchata was perfect--refreshing with just the right amount of cinnamon. Loved the fresh chips and salsa. We will definitely return."
Micha's,"The best Carne Seca tacos in town!  The chips and salsa are sooo good too. The service is very fast and efficient.  I have tried to eat here at least once a week for the last six months because I cannot get over how wonderful the Carne Seca tacos are.  My mom loved the salsa so much she asked to buy some and take it home, it was only $3!  Love this place!"
Street- Taco and Beer Co.,"Cool lil spot downtown!! Great food, awesome staff and great location. Job well done!! For sure try a la cha cha!!!!"
Penca,A little pricey but simply amazing street style tacos.  Another great place in the downtown Tucson Renaissance.
Taqueria Pico De Gallo,"LOVE THIS PLACE!
I just wish it weren't so far from where I live, yet it is still worth the drive now and then.
Personally I tend to order the fish tacos, always great. The beans and rice that come along with it aren't bad either and the carrots & onion that come with are tasty too.
The yellow building can't be missed, be sure to stop in next time you're near by! Really affordable good food. Also they have home made horchata and often jimaica both of which I could drink a liter of. yum."
Casa Molina Del Norte,"I love the margaritas at this place!  The nachos are great also, along with the fajitas, but what really draws me back is my favorite server, Rafael.  He is amazing!  He is so personable, and always makes sure we have a great time!  He will always stop and chat with us, even if just for a few minutes when they are busy, to make sure we are doing ok, and asks about our cats and dog (after a few margaritas here, I am showing the pictures on my phone to anybody that will look...of course Rafael always humors me).  Not to say we have ever had someone that was just alright.  Everybody that has served us has always gone above and beyond to make sure we are content with everything!  Also, the Sunday Brunch is spectacular.  Every time  I fill up my plate with what I think is just about everything, here they come with trays of different stuff that was not there before.  And so I have to go back.  By the end, I look similar to a penguin, waddling out to my car!  Just a great place for a relaxing, fun evening, with great service and good food!"
El Charro Cafe,Really happy I found this gem for Mexican in Oro Valley. The salsa is out of this world. The chips are thin with just the right amount of salt.  My mom and I had a great server named Robert.  We are both looking forward to coming back very soon.
BK Tacos,Absolutely love this place! The tasty food never disappoints and their cheledas are the best!
St Mary's Mexican Food,"Best tortillas I've ever eaten. Their burros are stuffed with well-seasoned, juicy meat. Salsa is hot and perfect. Simple, quick, delicious, authentic. Go there."
Charro Steak & Del Rey,"Visiting from out of town and stopped in on a Saturday night w/o reservations.  Although it was busy, we enjoyed the wait at the bar and had great service/apps.  Enrique was sure we got seated and was a very gracious host!   Fantastic food and stellar staff.  We'll be back!!"
BK Tacos,"Most people go for the Sonoran Dog, but if your in for the tacos i'd recommend this to anyone. El Guero Canelo doesn't have much variety. BK has the best Carne Asada & Al Pastor Tacos & Caramelos :D  The location on 1st is more of a U of A place to go to. I always go to the South Side location. Either way it's all worth it!"
Micha's,"We travel to Tucson and through Tucson a lot heading to Cochise County, and depending on the time of day we either breakfast, lunch or dinner here.  Always.  It's that good.  We like the atmosphere (laid back), the family members running the show, the long-time waitstaff AND the food.  Anything is good.  Seriously.  Breakfast chorizo and eggs, huevos rancheros are good choices, spouse loves their pancakes.  I love their refried beans doctored up with their kicky red salsa.  Gets a great eclectic mix of patrons which is distinctly Tucsonian, and that's fun too.  Live long and prosper MIcha's, we've enjoyed your food for years!"
El Charro Cafe,"Had a great dinner here tonight! We actually meant to go to the downtown location, but once we got here we decided to stay. Super cute decor, great service and phenom food. The salsa is very different than Dallas tex mex that I'm used to, but really good. 

I had the shrimp Sinaloa, and one of my co workers got the chicken with spinach mushrooms- everything our party got was awesome. Great find."
Charro Steak & Del Rey,Excellent night and food!  Had the carne Asada and shared a few sides with friends and everything was great!  Especially the Mac n cheese and guacamole prepared and served table side.  Great server and friendly atmosphere.  Love the locally owned feel.  Greeted by Owner. Will definitely go back.
Street- Taco and Beer Co.,This is a fabulous taco shop! The nachos and burrito was huge and tasty. The service and atmosphere was top notch. If I was still in town I'd go back.
Indian Frybread-Manna From Heaven,"I love this place. You know you're getting authentic local cuisine when you see grandma cooking in the kitchen and other family members are taking your order, serving and cleaning up. I've been here a few times and will continue to come back. A creature of habit - I've only had the green chile indian taco with the works and it's really tasty. My go to place for out of town visitors - have never heard a complaint (maybe because they're stuffing their face, lol). Support local businesses and get a great meal at the same time!!"
Penca,"It was delicious and a great option to celebrate our wedding anniversary. First time here, and the waitress was really helpful explaining the menu, and cocktails.

Ordered the Costilla de res and steak."
Street- Taco and Beer Co.,"Where to begin...the pollo asada is awesome, tender & flavorful!!! Get both the classic or hibiscus margarita! While it is a good lunch place, I'd also highly recommend it for dinner! Everyone was personable and provided great service!"
Taqueria Pico De Gallo,"Andrew Zimmerman from the food network ate here, but that's not why we came. We came for the handmade corn tortillas and ceviche. 

Cheap and delicious. Fat home made corn tortillas topped with a generous serving of shrimp ceviche made from marinated raw shrimp vs pre-cooked. The shrimp are still a bit grey but fully cooked from the acidity of the lime. 

Accompanied with delicious pickled red onions and carrots. 

Fish taco. Battered, fried, crispy light and delicious upon the plump hand made corn tortilla. 

Hole in the wall spot. Dingy but Delicious. Customers include dirtbag smelling kids in dreads and polished white folks in reading glasses.  Cheap, excellently prepared food appeals to all."
Maico,"One of the best places to get street tacos in Tucson. Large selection and super friendly service. Low prices make it an excellent value, and a must try for locals and visitors."
Charro Steak & Del Rey,"Wow - everything about this place is simply amazing!  We made reservations and were warmly greeted and quickly seated at a quiet, nice table overlooking the street and patio.  We had an amazing meal at El Charro earlier in the week, so we knew we were in for a treat at Charro Steak.  My husband and I shared the carne asada with manchego and peppers, the pork chop with prickly pear glaze, the grilled brussels sprouts and corn and the pinto beans. Everything was delicious, but the carne asada may have been the best I have ever tasted!

Convenient downtown location, great service, nicely appointed dining room and top notch food!"
Charro Steak & Del Rey,"We celebrated our wedding anniversary there, and the entire staff made it exceptionally special. The chef even came out and introduced himself and took extra care of us.  The food was outstanding, service was great and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. They had a fantastic acoustic guitar player which enhanced the whole experience.  This is not your typical steakhouse dining experience. It has an upscale southwestern vibe to it. Go try it!"
El Charro Cafe,"I am in town visiting my parents and though we normally prefer trying out new places, we came for dinner the second night in a row tonight. This place is so good! It was the salsa that hooked us all, but our meals were equally as delicious. The manager, Miguel, is so hospitable and welcoming. He brought us out some amAzing sauces to try. Our waiter, who shared that he was a student studying engineering and also had a second job, was so wonderful and attentive, despite my thoughts that two jobs and an engineering degree in progress likely involves a lack of sleep. I am a vegetarian, and their veggie selection is Fantastic. The vegetarian enchiladas are especially delicious. Thank you!"
Indian Frybread-Manna From Heaven,"Tastes as good as everyone says it does, absolutely will go back again. Service was great. I was having a hard time picking the red or green chili so they gave me a sample of both, I would be happy with either but went with the red.

One serving could probably feed two, I had well over half of mine left over.

My only possible concern would be the place was a bit warm and it wasn't even 100 outside. They only appear to have swamp cooling so when it hits 110 out and/or the humidity gets high it may get unpleasant."
El Merendero,"Best beans in Tucson!!! Wow - incredible beans! Fish tacos were excellent. Super cheap, friendly staff. What a great find!!!"
BK Tacos,"This is one of the best eating places of Tucson. They have one of the best carne asada marinated meats in all of AZ, you have to try it to believe it! Very few places will compare in the entire state."
Charro Steak & Del Rey,"Enjoyed a tasting menu through Verizon and left stuffed. Viva Rosa Margarita was delightfully fruity and delicious. Table side guacamole was perfect, and lasted through the main course. Carne asada and pollo asada were served with beans, pico, and some slaw concoction that was great on the tacos. Pollo asada was a little different than I'm used to, with barbecue sauce on top, but was still good (wife almost choked on it because of the heat of the sauce). Overall, great service and amazing food!"
Taqueria El Cheke,"Los tacos estan muy buenos, autentico sabor de sonora, la barra de salsa muy fresco y buena atencion, abren hasta tarde."
El Dorado,"This isn't the place for Chile Relleno, big whoop. Try something else, like their chile con carne and you will experience true sonoran food.  As a fifth generation Arizona with roots in Tucson's Mexican community, I have to say they have the best  red chile con carne. The chile sauce is more than just any chile sauce. It has real flavor I haven't found at any other Mexican restaurant. South Tucson has some great Mexican food! 

If you get the ritas, try on the rocks. 

It's always a good sign you're at a good mexican restaurant when almost everybody you see there is Mexican. Also, no need to worry about language barriers like one of my friends was afraid of, the waiter I had, who apparently works there regularly can speak English with barely even a trace of a Mexican accent. 

Foood and atmosphere was impressive!"
El Charro Cafe,Excellent service and the food was great! Such a fun find on our trip! We liked it so much after our first night we came back for our last night. The ambience is adorable and has a Tucson vibe!
Charro Steak & Del Rey,Absolutely amazing service and delicious food. We were there last night for my mother n laws birthday and it was a large party with kids. Our waiter was accommodating to my allergies and treated our kids the same as the adults. He was so polite and friendly. He even opened the door for us as we were leaving. Absolutely great time. Will go again when I'm back in Tucson.
Street- Taco and Beer Co.,"My favorite place to eat and watch the game.  Great, fresh food plus a nice chips and salsa bar.  Very Affordable.  Also, if you check in after 3pm on YELP, you get a free taco."
Street- Taco and Beer Co.,"I love Street! Victor makes this place home for me and all my friends. If you go to the bar, ask for Victor!"
BK Tacos,"One of my favorite taco spots, great guac, order some carne tacos, and a michilada with some Mexican beer."
Aqui Con El Nene,"Better Sonoran dogs than BK and much better than Guero Canelo. It was a bit toasty sitting outside, but the food was well worth it!"
Penca,"Great food and drinks.  Cozy restaurant and great for people watching.  I like the mescal cocktail, smoky and not too sweet.  I dined with my 11 year old and he loved the ""chicarrons""...fried pork skins.  We've been there a few times and the food is always wonderful.  Nice atmosphere and we were happy with the service."
Charro Steak & Del Rey,Honestly the carne asada steak is insanely good. The meat was very tender and juicy and full if flavor. I also recommend the potatoes with Chile en rajas. Overall food and service 12/10.
Casa Molina Del Norte,This is my absolute favorite restaurant.  I have to go here first thing when I come to Tucson.  They have the best carne seca.  You just can not find this outside of the Tucson area.  You must get the carne seca burro enchilada style and a green Chile cheese crisp.  There is nothing better.
St Mary's Mexican Food,"This is the best Mexican food in Tucson. I have used their catering services for my wedding, my baby shower, and family birthday parties and have received nothing but rave reviews. Their customer service goes above and beyond and I have no complaints! I highly recommend St. Mary's for any occasion - from a quick bite to eat to a big life event - they are simply the best!"
Charro Steak & Del Rey,"Our son chose this restaurant to celebrate his graduation from U of A. The food and service were both excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed the table side guacamole. In addition to delicious steaks and carne asada, they had many gf and vegetarian options to suit all of our needs. The branzino was wonderful! We were so full, we didn't take them up on their offer of a free dessert!"
St Mary's Mexican Food,"I love their bean tostadas, also red chili burros are delicious, service is okay can't complaint"
St Mary's Mexican Food,"Best tortillas in town. Try the red chili or chile rellenos. Quality is like any sit-down place in town, but better prices."
Seis Kitchen,So glad to have Seis here in Oro Valley! The space is gorgeous and spacious and there's a lovely patio with a view of Pusch Ridge. We visited and enjoyed some delicious margaritas and split the nachos - so yummy and plenty of food to share. You order at the counter and they deliver the food and drinks to your seat. Our service was quick and the everything was delicious. The watermelon marg is one of my favorite in town. Welcome to OV!
El Charro Cafe,"We tried again tonight and had absolutely excellent service and food. The waitress was very attentive, the food was fresh, and all the employees worked as a team. I was glad to have another great experience here."
Penca,"We went for my birthday and I did not get disappointed. The drinks were amazing and unique. We first ordered the mole appetizer sample and it did not disappoint us at all. Then The seafood tostada which was delicious and the pozzole. I don't remember what my husband had but he was in heaven and let me try it and it was so tasty. Maybe it was some kind of short rib tacos maybe. 
My daughter had the coliflor tacos and they were surprisingly super delicious. I'm thinking of getting that for myself next night. 
I definitely recommend this place. And loved the atmosphere too. Maybe a little dark but still enjoyable."
Club 21,The carne seca is AMAZING!!! Flavorful and authentic!  This is a very calm and kind place to eat. Staff is very friendly and I really appreciated the service.  I will DEFINITELY return!
Tacos Apson,"Love the tacos here, always have, I'm glad to see they opened a new location closer. The Cashiers are always helpful and friendly, the meat is always fresh, and everything's there, Always coming back!!"
Charro Steak & Del Rey,"Went here for a work event and ordered from a limited menu. Had my heart set on a burger but got pushed to a prickly pear BBQ chicken. I was glad for it in the end. It might have been the best BBQ chicken dish I ever ate. Those nearby reported the steak was excellent.

A word to the management, though. When serving communal desserts you might consider including a communal knife and fork too. Just sayin. Human behaviors under such constraints yield a condition in which I don't get to try dessert."
Taqueria Pico De Gallo,"After hearing about Taqueria Pico de Gallo for years, I only discovered it on a research trip to a school in South Tucson, bright yellow and beckoning on my commute. I am so glad I saw it!

Corn tortillas. Corn tortillas. Corn tortillas. I am convinced that this place has the best fish tacos in the world, but anything would taste great on those tortillas. The homemade horchata is a wonder, and I adore the Pico de Gallo: tropical fruit covered in a delicious mix of lime, salt, and chile. It is the perfect accompaniment to a plate of tacos, especially on a hot day."
Taqueria El Cheke,"The abodaba was the absolute best I've ever had. The spices were perfect. It was moist, flavorful. I had it on the Lorenza, a toasted street taco, and in a caramello. Both very delicious! The corn tortilla for the Lorenza was toasted perfectly. The Chipilon style Sonoran Dog was good, but not their star dish. The service is friendly. Last night, one of the brothers in this business saw my daughter had her purse on the table in our party of three so he came out, got a chair from another table and put it on the end of our table and put her purse on it. How sweet!

So today I went to see my daughter at work and I asked her what her plans were when she got off. She replied that she was going to go eat. I asked where, to which she replied ""Back at the taco place:"" to which i laughed and said, ""So am I!"" We both were thinking about it all day because it was so good. That was hilarious. But the fact is, the abodaba is excellent!

5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.

4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.

3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.

2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.

1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!"
Penca,Hands down best mexican food and drinks in Tucson
Taqueria Pico De Gallo,"Great Sonoran street food!  Went on the recommendation of a coworker today, and am glad I did.  Plenty of food for the money, served VERY hot, and obviously made with love.  I'll be back!"
El Merendero,"Great food Had the stuffed chili relleno.  Salsa were good too.  Very nice waitress named Karen.   They do not have a full bar. They only serve wine margaritas, wine and beer."
Taqueria Pico De Gallo,"I won't say it's the best taqueria in Tucson - such statements are way above my pay grade.

However, this place never fails to satisfy. It's a no-frills hole in the wall that delivers, and it's the pretentious-free ambiance and the hand-made thick corn tortillas that really make this place stand out. The fried fish and cabeza tacos are my go-to selections here. No matter what you order, though, you will not leave unsatisfied.

You will reserve a special place in your stomach for Taqueria Pico de Gallo."
La Indita,"Made a place for us! Seated immediately on a busy night. Service with a broad smile. Great menu, scrumptious homemade chips and salsa. Great, slightly sweet green chili on the enchiladas, and nice shredded cabbage garnish. Delicious tamarind drink, made on the premises. Great Tucson tradition, with the real La Indita making the tortillas. AMAZINGLY GOOD FOOD. ."
Taqueria Juanito's,Delicious tacos not to be missed! Great Carne Asada and Al pastor all freshly made and cooked perfectly :) Don't miss this gem!
el Pollo Lucky,"Pollo Nuevo..
I like the food here.. 
Haven't had a bad meal here yet..
Usually get 1/2 chicken , rice , macaroni salad
Mmmmm."
La Indita,"We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. My friend had just arrived from the Czech Republic and he wanted a typical Tucson dining experience. La Indita did not disappoint. The special was chicken enchiladas with a green sauce, rice and beans. Everything was like I like it. The rice was flavorful and not clumpy. The beans were spiced just right and creamy. The chicken was clearly cooked that day. So yummy! My friend enjoyed his albodinga soup and complimentary sample plate. Service was great! I don't know why I don't eat here more often! I'll be back soon."
Chipotle Mexican Grill,"I always have amazing service when eating at this Chipotle; the employees are very friendly and go above and beyond. The restaurant is always very clean, and the food is (of course) delicious."
Tumerico,Everything was delicious & seasoned just right! Wendy is a great chef & a great soul. You can taste the love she imparts to her food.
Las Margaritas Restaurants,"Amazing Mexican food! Family has been coming here for years! I'm not a local but every time I visit Tucson, this restaurant is a must! 
Mini Chimis are bomb. Red chili is superb."
El Sur Restaurant,"Yum! Very busy at lunch,  y muy delicioso... the chicken chimi combo and a Patron Margarita made the trip to Tucson worthwhile."
Guillermo's Double L Restaurant,"The first time our family came (includes 3 kids).  Decorations are nice feels like home and as soon as we were seated we were all given water, chips & salsa.  Chips & Salsa were good spicy and no spicy.  Waiters was great and attentive, reasonable prices. Husband had chicken enchiladas, I ordered Melinesa, kids ordered hotdog and a breakfast burrito all so good."
Cinco De Mayo Mexican Restaurant & Seafood,"I ate here a few months ago after hearing that is was the same menu as my favorite place, Guillermo's. The happy hour menu is dangerous (VERY reasonably priced!). Great place, beautiful interior and friendly staff. Will definitely come back when it reopens!"
Taqueria Juanito's,"We stopped here while driving thru Tucson from California to Texas. We arrived too late for breakfast but got carne asada tacos and the barbacoa plate. The meat was tender and well seasoned, tortillas were fresh, and the salsa was hot. What a wonderful meal! The service as also super friendly and fast."
Taqueria Juanito's,"Very good food, and a great value. The ceviche tostada was delicious and fresh, the chicken burrito was savory and flavorful, beans and rice were good and two tasty types of salsas, with a little kick. Highly recommend. Parking was easy"
Tumerico,"Even if you are not vegetarian, you have to check out Tumerico. The flavor profiles in these dishes are outstanding!! It's truly a one-of-a-kind restaurant. You can get all your favorite Mexican dishes in Vegetarian or Vegan form and it tastes even better than from a traditional Mexican restaurant. The service is always on point. The staff are all so friendly and happy to be there. Also - endless coffee is always a plus!! I could eat here every week."
Tumerico,"The food is delicious, the service is ok, and you get a nice vegan dessert with your meal too. The cookie was pretty crumbly and dry, almost cracker like. I'm not here for that so I'm not counting that against them. It's free!

The menu changes all the time so whenever you go you get something new. I know that for some, that can be kind of annoying but I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
Taqueria Juanito's,"Best Mexican carry out!  Period!  

I like the combinations, enough for 4 great tacos with beans and rice for $6.50.

Downsides: 1. However, eating there not so posh. 2. No beer."
El Molinito,"I just had El Molinito cater my father's birthday party and I was very pleased! First of all, I found them super affordable. Under $600 for the deluxe, plus drinks, set up, tear down, for 40 people way out in Catalina! I thought that was going to be tough, but nope, no problem.

Next, the food: we are all Southern Californians, so we don't know much about Sonoran Mexican food.  YUM! The beans were oh so good! The shredded beef was divine. HUGE amount of guacamole and sour cream.  Fruit changas for desert? I never heard of them, but they were super yummy.

And finally, major shout out to Andy, the manager of the Oro Valley restaurant.  He came out in his own car, set everything up, then came back and took away all the dirties that night.  He even brought containers for leftovers (which we totally devoured the next couple of days). 

I'm really happy with this place.  Will head there to the restaurant next time I'm in Tucson."
Tumerico,A great recommendation from a stranger sent us here. We had a fantastic meal here. Reminded us a lot of the great flavors from a trip to Costa Rica. Portions are generous. Included soup and coffee is a plus. Consider showing up on the shoulder of lunch time since the business was hopping. Give it a shot!
Tumerico,We loved it. Such imaginative flavors and fantastic food.  Lovely place for casual dinner!
Tumerico,"This food is heavenly and incredible, very fresh, menu changes daily,  very personable staff, really clean. Turmeric lemonade is out of this world. Empanadas are a must to try"
Taqueria Juanito's,I have eaten here at least a dozen times and I have never been disappointed. They have a hard working staff that makes great dishes. It also in a good value for your dollar.
El Sur Restaurant,I absolutely adored this place. The service was SPECTACULAR from the moment you walked through the doors! I ordered the vegan fajitas and my friend ordered the chicken enchiladas with fried Oreo ice cream. We had an experienced server and a server who was in training. Both were absolutely fantastic. The food was very affordable. I would 100% recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to experience authentic Mexican cuisine while in Tucson!
Tumerico,"Bomb diggagy  Vegetarian food has never been so good. This place is too legit to quit. One of the best restaurants in tucson. Best Tacos Best Smoothies and you can do yoga there, taking health and wellness to another level. I'm gunna Salivate as I Elevate. Coffee is King. Go there and Stand by to Get Some"
Karichimaka Restaurant,So yummy!  Worth the drive....a perfect stop after a trip to the Sonora desert museum   The perfect place to try a signature  Tucson cheese crisp
Taqueria Juanito's,"This is the best small authentic taqueria I've ever been too. Great food, great prices and great customer service. Food taste fresh and not over seasoned. Great experience, definitely would come back here for the post 8:30pm Mexican."
Toro Loco,"Really amazing food. I have been here several times and usually stick to the vegetarian options. The last time I tried their pork pastor taco, it was also very delicious. Vegetarian burritos and tacos are still my favorite."
Casa Del Rio,"Was here for the first time last Friday night and had the carne asada chimichanga. It was absolutely amazing the steak melted in your mouth like butter, also got to try the Mexican pizza, so delicious. The prices are very reasonable and the service was outstanding. I definitely will go back to eat at this place."
Mariscos Chihuahua,"Super yummy place. Prices were a bit steep but it's seafood, so can't explain. Took my team of college tennis players that are from all over the world (USA, Mexico and Africa) and they all loved it. Big portions and such good flavors!  

Service was great. I forgot her name, but our server was so nice and explained everything to the players that never really ate Mexican food. The fried red snapper was amazing. Nicely fried and not oily. The Cameron Rellenos are super crunchy and the shrimp inside was still so flavorful and soft.  Oysters were ok... not as chilled as I would like. Nonetheless, yummy."
Tumerico,"Fantastic! Great service, amazing food! The restaurant is loud (we went on a Friday during lunch) so it's not the place to go for a quiet conversation but it is worth driving to Tucson from Phoenix for - seriously."
La Hacienda Restaurant,"Great food!  I got take away, and was pleasantly surprised that they included a bag of chips and salsa!  The people I interacted with were lovely, too."
Toro Loco,Amazing tacos!!! My husband had the fried Chicken tacos and I had the sweet corn chicken tacos and both were yummy!!! The side order of sweet corn is to die for!!! A hidden treasure off Broadway and Pantano!!!
Charro del Rey,This is our first experience dining at Charro del Rey. We were celebrating a very special occasion. Farrah was amazing! She gave us great direction and we had a  fabulous meal. We can't wait to return - Charro del Rey just became one of our favorite restaurants!
El Sur Restaurant,The best mom and pop Mexican restaurant there is no questions asked. There menu is extensive and we've tried so many different things and they all turn out great. Wonderful staff and environment always genuinely thankful that you came in. Me and my family go there as often as we can!
El Sur Restaurant,We can't say enough about how much we love El Sur! The food is flavorful and fresh. The staff is all friendly and invite you in like family. Is twice a week too often to visit? We can't get enough!! Thank you El Sur!!
Karichimaka Restaurant,"Stopped here for dinner as they didn't have a wait and so many restaurants had an hour or more wait....that being said we weren't sure what to expect. We are SO glad we did! 
Beautiful outdoor patio, friendly service, and great food. The tortillas were soft, pipping hot and homemade, the salad was huge, and the fajitas were awesome with a freshly grilled taste. Hot and delicious sopa pillas for desert topped off the night. 
Thank you so much and we can't wait to come here again in our next visit to Tucson!"
Toro Loco,So freaking delicious! You must try the Hot Habanero Burro & Loco Fries! Definitely filling!
Mariscos Chihuahua,I love this little place and authentic Mexican seafood. Go for whole fried Snapper and ceviche.
La Indita,"The most authentic Mexican food I've ever had! Everything is homemade, the service was exceptional, and the ambiance was relaxing and homey. Especially recommend their mole, enchiladas, and tacos. Such a great spot with delicious food and excellent staff."
Taqueria Juanito's,"This is one of my favorite places in Tucson!! The food is always on point and the prices are affordable relative to other overpriced Mexican restaurants. The taco plate comes with rice, beans, avocado, and plenty of tortillas. The quesadilla is massive and absolutely delicious. The Jamaica is one of the best too! I can't wait to order again!"
Karichimaka Restaurant,Moved away from Tucson many years ago. When visiting recently noticed Karichimaka was still there so stopped for lunch. It was as good as I remembered it to be.
Tumerico,One of my fav restaurants ever! BEST food and awesome people! I feel like I could eat there every day and never get sick of it. One of my favorites is the Ropa Vieja plate but every time I try something new it becomes one of my favorites. The breakfast burrito is the best I've ever had. Just pure awesomeness on every level!
The Landing,Great new spot by the owners and collaborators of Finis Landing (Swan and Sunrise). Love supporting local ventures and this place makes it so easy. Great vibe and friendly staff. Excited to see how this new concept settles into the neighborhood. Get the Crispy Birria Tacos.
Karichimaka Restaurant,Love Karichimaka. Favorite restaurant for 40+ years! Great food. Family setting. Loyal staff.
Tumerico,"One of the best lunches I have had in a very long time.  Haven't been to a vegetarian restaurant since I was in California several years ago.  Everything looked so good it was a hard decision, but settled on the Cuban tacos with rice, beans and salad.  It was absolutely delicious.  Looking forward to coming back next time we are in Arizona.  So very good!!   Yum, Yum!!"
Tumerico,First time here and was incredibly happy with the food and service! Love this place and will be back!!!
Tumerico,"We went to Tumerico last night and the staff were very friendly and attentive! The food was so delicious and filled with lots of veggies. The plates were very big and could easily be shared. The leftovers made for a quick and tasty lunch the next day. The tortilla chips and tortillas were also spot on.

I asked if they had a kids menu and they said that they can make whatever my son wanted. His meal came with a delicious quesadilla, guacamole, salad, rice and beans. It was the best kids meal that I have ever seen! We will definitely be coming back. Thanks for the delightful experience!"
The Landing,Great Taco Place. Food was absolutely amazing! Alex the waitress was great she made sure to tell us about the alcohol that they had and the food choices!!!  Great smile and great service!
Leo's,My friend and I googled Mexican food in the area and Leo's had excellent reviews. They are very friendly and greeted us as we came in. Food was excellent and reasonable. Highly recommend it!!!
Tumerico,"Delicious! Wasn't expecting the flavor for a vegan dish, but wow. Definitely recommend eating here!"
Tumerico,"Tumerico has the best vegan food in Tucson. Hands down. The first thing that strikes you when you walk in is the wonderful aroma. Then when you take in the ever-changing menu you start to realize this fast-casual cafe does not serve typical fast-casual food. The dishes are vibrant and colorful. And you can taste every ingredient within its proper balance and texture. 

Tucson food culture is well represented here, like with tamales, enchiladas, tortas, flautas, burros, etc. But the menu also includes a regular rotation of curry dishes, Cuban dishes, noodles, salads, all sorts of stuff really. 

We ordered the Squash Blossom Gorditas ($14). Shareable and absolutely delicious. Served with seasoned rice and beans, with a fresh mixed salad, every single bite had a blend of well-prepared flavors. The beans in particular had a wonderful smokiness to them. The masa dough was well textured, but not too tough. (Quibble alert: the gorditas were really sopes: little cup-shaped mounds of fresh masa. Labels aside, yummmm.) And the vanilla cream was wonderfully light and, well, creamy. 

Tumerico is the kind of place where you leave feeling better than when you came in. So please be sure to check it out. Some 5 star places on Yelp don't deserve their ratings. But Tumerico definitely does."
Cafe Poca Cosa,"I have been here twice. This is easily one of the greatest restaurants in Tucson because it is so unique, located in a great area, and beautiful inside.

I love the rotating menu that is brought out on a chalkboard and changes on a daily basis. This is authentic Mexican food. It's nothing like the standard American style Mexican that most people are used to. The mole is very good, the carne asada is fresh, they also give you fresh fruit with most courses. The salsa is very good and fresh, and the plantains are excellent!

Definitely worth a visit for locals and for visitors alike. The food is very tasty and fresh as well as very authentic."
Cafe Poca Cosa,"Anytime we are in Tucson we come here. It never disappoints us. Chiefs plate is always a great way to taste much of the ever changing menu. One of my best meals tonight. Only wish we had this place in San Diego. They do get busy so make a reservation. Parking garage right here. Fast services great atmosphere
 Do try this place."
Seis Kitchen,"Love their pork burritos! Great restaurant and service!
The last time we were there they messed up our order and they gave our order for free and kept apologizing! Great service!"
Gigi's Mexican Peruvian Fusion,"I never know what to get at Food Truck Roundups, but something about the Gigi's truck caught my eye (perhaps the bright green? Visual menu board??) and I just had to try it! 

I decided on the Steak and Shrimp Burrito. It was later in the event and they had run out of shrimp, so they kindly charged a little less. The steak was tender and juicy. The burrito was a tasty treat and incredibly filling! I was able to save half for the next day! An awesome burrito is a meal in and of itself, but Gigi's includes the most amazing fries with their food!! The fries are thick and the perfect balance between crispy and soft! I loved every bite of this meal and cannot wait for them to return to Sahuarita!"
El Taco Tote,The absolute best Mexican food in Tucson. Period. Great prices. Ice cold beer. Real chips and multiple tasty salsas.
Cafe Poca Cosa,"Cafe Poca Cosa offers a great concept in cuisine, with an inviting menu that changes twice a day. Every dish sounded so delicious that I was ecstatic when the waitress mentioned their special surprise dish with mini versions of 3 dishes that they had. I look forward to my next time here and what new creations they will have in store."
Casa Molina,"For four months, my husband and I planned our 40th anniversary party at another restaurant. One week prior to the party, they told us that they had double-booked and we were out of luck! What was I going to do? I went into Casa Molina and Gilbert, the manager, calmly asked, ""What can we do to make this happen?""

He listened to what we had planned at the other restaurant. With most of the items on my list, he said they could accommodate our wishes. If they couldn't, he offered reasonable alternatives. 

There was exceptional communication among the staff. Over the next frantic week, there were several phone calls and personal visits between us. Everyone I talked to already knew our expectations for the party. 

Lisa gave us excellent advice on human nature - where guests were most likely to congregate, etc. We based our seating arrangement on her recommendations and it was very comfortable and functional. 

Even though it was an inconvenience for them, they removed items from the patio that weren't needed for our party such as heaters, serving shelves, etc. Gilbert arranged for chairs to be delivered from the restaurant that had dumped us because we had purchased chair covers for banquet chairs. 

We were allowed to decorate early in the day but then it rained! Gilbert offered to dry the tablecloths for us but fortunately, that wasn't necessary. 

Several of our guests commented on how friendly and accommodating the staff was. They went above and beyond and the party was perfect! Thank you so much!"
Casa Molina,"This is our family restaurant. Every friday we are there. Its great when you walk in and can have the same server who knows your order without even asking. When he brings you a bowl of the salsa you like, Jorge knows my dad likes the hot stuff, and me I like a bowl of stewed tomatoes, which he brings to the table as soon as we sit down.  I always get the chicken chimichanga. ITS HUGE and amazing! My dad always has the red chili burro or chili con carne. Some days its good some days its not hot at all. But we always love how friendly everyone is."
Cafe Poca Cosa,"Best restaurant in Tucson! Make reservations and arrive on time. Order the plata Poca Cosa and enjoy the food! Their drinks are really good too, especially the Cadillac margarita."
Whata Burro,"This review is for our take out experience. We ordered the percheron bacon wrapped burro and the Sonoran bacon wrapped burro. 

The marinate of the meat is great. Not like Mexico but close! And common, the bacon is enginuity at it's food trucks finest. They had Mexican sodas and horchata for sale. There are only maybe 6 small tables and 5 tall bar stools to eat on site. The parking is difficult when it's rush hour and is shared with the liquor store next door. We waited 15 to 20 minutes for 2 burros and it wasn't too busy. 

They also have salsas, lemons and plastic cutlery for your convenience. One and done place. LOVED the burro! But my arteries will appreciate not going back."
Tanias 33 Mexican Food,"Feeling fortunate a local suggested we visit Tania's. Delicious food, friendly woman at the counter, clean bathrooms, very fair price. 
We ordered tacos, an enchilada and tamales, all accompanied by rice, beans and a drink from the cooler. The el pastor was especially tasty, with grilled pineapple and cilantro added to the pork."
Costa Vida Fresh Mexican Grill,I loveeeee costa vida! Salads are my favorite with the shredded beef and the tomatillo ranch - not to mention it's quick and convenient!
Costa Vida Fresh Mexican Grill,"I love this place. The service is consistently fabulous. They cook the steak perfectly, tender and flavorful. The sweet pork is too sweet for me.  The grilled chicken is great,  too!  Portions are large, tortillas are fresh-cooked, and there is something for everyone.  The amazing service is just icing on the cake."
Cafe Poca Cosa,You must try the mole negro and the agua Fresca of the day. One of my favorite spots downtown.
Cafe Poca Cosa,Probably the best mexican food I've ever eaten!  The menu changes daily so I suggest you get the sampler plate.  All the flavors were so unique and each dish was a masterpiece.  You won't find more refined Mexican food anywhere.  I wish they had one of these in SF. =(
Cafe Poca Cosa,"One of our beat dining experiences ever! Our waitress was great, the menu phenomenal! The presentation of the food was gorgeous! The atmosphere completely relaxing and comfortable! And the food was over the top! Fantastic! Melt in your mouth delicious from first to last bite! We would recommend this to anyone and everyone! A must when you are in Tucson!"
Cafe Poca Cosa,"The best Mexican food place in Tucson, possibly in the state ;) Go hungry. Comb your hair, dress just a little above casual, and get a big margarita and the chef's choice plate. Order desert. You won't be sorry."
Taco Giro Mexican Grill - W Valencia,"This is where we bring our guests from out of town to experience the local cuisine.  We have never had a bad meal here, and the service is great!  My mother is diabetic and prefers veggies to rice and beans and she is always accommodated.  Haven't tried breakfast here yet but I'll bet it's good."
El Taco Tote,"I love this little place, great flavors of food and big portions and the condiment bar is big."
Cafe Poca Cosa,"Plato Poca Cosa ...the chef's choice plate is 3 samplings (but very sizeable) of what's on the menu for the time being + very large salad.  Very tasty and delectable, not to mention the presentation of their meals are spectacular -- use of color, placement on plate... its edible art.  The house salsa was SO GOOD.  I couldn't stop eating chips & salsa even after my meal arrived.   

  Their menu changes twice a day? Something like that.  It's a spoken menu so make sure to pay attention because I wasn't...but I already know going in that I wanted the Chef's plate.  I was warned by a friend that I'll walk out feeling very stuffed and that was very true.

The El Patron Margarita was divine.  I wanted a 2nd glass but it was time to drive home so that was a no-go."
Sir Veza's Taco Garage,I enjoyed the food. I always have a fish taco when I eat here. I can't complain about the service. I had it delivered.
Cafe Poca Cosa,Lucy is amazing! I called the restaurant and asked a huge favor of her and she took the extra time to help me. I will forever be grateful! Thank you Lucy!!
Tanias 33 Mexican Food,I can see why this place has been around for years!! The owner has the best customer service skills.  Cheap prices.  Only thing I didn't like we're the tamales from freezer.  Everything else is great
El Minuto Cafe,As good as it gets for local Sonoran fare. Love the abondiga soup. Super nice family runs the place.
Villa Mexican Food,This is still my favorite Mexican food in Tucson.  It's a good as it gets.  The salsa is sooooo amazing and the menu filled with great options.  I eat here several times a month including lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed.
Costa Vida Fresh Mexican Grill,"Great, fast, fresh, mexican food. Super tasty and crunchy nachos. Make it your own from salads, tacos, nachos, enchiladas."
Cafe Poca Cosa,"My husband  and I went to Cafe Poca Cosa for our date night this eve. It was everything that I had heard, and more! The atmosphere was romantic but also had a family feel to it and our servers were outstanding! 

The food? Well it was delightfully flavorful and was exquiste in the presentation. We both got the Chefs picks, and neither one of us were disapointed. We met the owner, who was warm and seemed genuinley happy we came in. We will definantley be back and would highly recommend this restaurant!"
Cafe Poca Cosa,"This is a fantastic downtown spot if you are looking for something wonderfully Tucson. Take your date here. Impress her with your culinary prowess. Order her a margarita (I recommend the Pocanoche, but really - let your heart be your guide). Then another. And possibly another. 

It's a low-lit place with fabulous decor. For a the first couple of minutes you will wonder if you are still actually in Tucson or if you got somehow Narnia'd into a bigger, better city where everyone is impossibly hip. Last time I was there I saw not one but two separate gentlemen wearing suspenders. I felt like I needed to go up to them and apologize for not being hip enough. ""Sorry guys, I just. I put on this dress and... I'm sorry.""

Last night my ladyfriend and I went for dinner and drinks. We had a reservation at 7 and arrived just a little early. We expected to wait until a little bit closer to our reservation time, so we grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered some margaritas. They were, of course, exceptional. The wait ended up being a little bit longer than expected, but I really don't care. I don't understand people who freak out when their table isn't ready at exactly 7:00 pm on the dot. I honestly have no idea when we actually got seated and I didn't really care - I was having a great time. I could tell they were busy, it even took a while for our server to come explain the menu to us. Solution: drink another cocktail! All of your worries will disappear. Hey look chips are here. 

Honestly, if you're not getting the Plato Poca Cosa I'm not sure if you understand how food works. The premise is that the Chef gives you a plate with three different entree bits on it and then covers the plate in a giant salad so that you have to hunt for your food and have a wonderful time discovering new things. The tamale pie is insanely good, sweet without cloying. It's definitely not dessert, but it's a wonderful change from the other two flavors on the plate. 

Never forget the second best part of the Plato: at the end. While you are busily hacking your way through the salad jungle for more bits of meat and hidden parts of tamale pie that you missed (OH GOD THERE'S MORE AND IT WAS HIDDEN AND NOW I FOUND IT YESSSS), the sauces are doing their work. They are mingling. Last night I had the birria and the mole negro and tamale pie. The sauces from each of these things slowly began to combine in the center of the plate. Remember the rice and beans? You forgot it, didn't you? Now is the time. Put the rice on the place in the middle of the megasauce and then, even though you are really full, you continue to consume.

Feeling full? Fight through it, champ, cause it's time for dessert."
Sir Veza's Taco Garage,"We went in on a busy Friday night and had our dog with us. The main patio was full and there was a 15 minutes wait for a table. Since we just wanted margaritas, I asked if we could get a margarita at the bar and just drink over on the side patio (which didn't away to currently be open). The hostess said that was fine and when they slowed down a bit she even brought us chips and offered us a server, which I really appreciated because she didn't have to.

Thanks!!"
Nico's Taco Shop,Their service was amazing they're very polite and fast and the food was very tasty they Rock I highly recommend
Salsa Verde Restaurant,"I don't post much but This place warranted it.  I must say that I loved my experience. Clean, friendly bright, very helpful and appreciative staff and fantastic food and very reasonable pricing."
Cafe Poca Cosa,"My favorite Mexican Restaurant in Tucson by far! A great location with tasteful decor. I always get the Plato poca cosa that includes 3 random items from the menu and I have NEVER been disappointed. Love the concept, they change the entire menu daily so you never know what to expect but the dishes are amazing. Anytime I'm in town I try to get in and take business visitors as well!"
Guadalajara Original Grill,The food is great. The atmosphere is awesome. The Salsa ladies make it so much fun. Their chicken mole is great!
El Taco Tote,"Consistently good! Fresh extensive salsa bar. Chips and more. Pork, beef, chicken and fish. Tacos, quesadillas, fajita platters all delicious. Charro beans, grilled onions, rice and baked potatoes . Great menu selection and reasonably priced. Very family friendly."
Salsa Verde Restaurant,"What a spectacular find Salsa Verde was for my wife and I. We had taken a day trip to Tucson to visit the Pima air and space museum, which is huge, and we had skipped lunch. So obviously when we finished checking out the museum we were in need of top quality sustenance. Of course our first move was to see what was highly rated on Yelp! After going over several options we decided on Salsa Verde. We promptly drove over to Salsa Verde and I ordered the two ground beef taco plate special and my wife got the mini-taco plate. The restaurant was very clean upon entry, with an exceptional salsa bar. Once I received my taco plate I was blown away by the size of the combo. The portion was impressive for being a special. The tacos were quite tasty, the beans and rice were also very tasty. Also, delicious chips for only $1! The service matched the quality of the meal, very friendly and timely. I highly recommend Salsa Verde, I just wish they had one in Las Vegas!"
Cafe Poca Cosa,"I don't know if there are enough positive adjectives to describe how good the food is at Cafe Poca Cosa.  What I can say is that when I have work trips to the Tucson area I avoid traveling on a Monday or Tuesday when Cafe Poca Cosa is closed.  A true highlight of visiting Tucson and a must visit restaurant while you are in town.

Upscale Mexican Food restaurant with a menu that changes every night.  Super fresh ingredients with a stunning visual presentation - lots of color with melon, pineapple, salad, and fresh grapes.  The meat dishes are truly spectacular.  Tastes like the meats have been simmering for days in their delicious pepper based sauces.

Ambiance is very cool as well.  Thick velvet curtains, dim lights, soft music, modern bar with great wines, professional hostess and wait staff all combine to make a truly special experience.  

Can't wait for my travels to bring me back to Tucson so I can visit Cafe Poca Cosa again!!"
Seis Kitchen,"In town for UofA graduation and celebration dinner here.
Everything was great. Between the 16 of us, we probably ordered everything on the menu. Food was excellent as was the service.
They make one of the best Bloody Mary's I've tasted"
La Botana Tacos,I saw this place on ubereats and decided to try it out! I ordered a carne asada taco salad and this thing is HUGE. which I mean for $10 for a salad it should be. The flavor is great and I love this crema that they have on top I didn't even use the salad dressing that came on the side. I'm about a quarter of the way done and super full already. I'm pleased with this place!
Salsa Verde Restaurant,"Delicious Pozole soup hands down. The customer service could use and attitude adjustment. The food is worth the attitude. All in all, great place to eat!"
La Botana Tacos,"Botana was exactly what we were looking for -- delicious street tacos, homemade salsas, tasty margaritas and a nice outdoor patio to enjoy them on."
Jack in the Box,"Jack Butter burgers the best I tasted! Juicy and doesn't fall apart, coupons make it scary good!
Fast efficient service and courteous too, so worth it!"
Cafe Poca Cosa,"Most unique Mexican Food I have ever had.  Great margaritas and delicious food.  I see a lot of complaints about the service, and, while I have never had too much of a bad experience with the service, I would gladly trade service based on the excellent food you get.

It is a must to order the special and roll the dice.  I have done it dozens of times and was never disappointed. 

With the special you get a salad, some fruit, and three entrees that are up to the chef.  No one person at your table will get the same plate when ordering the special.

Decor at new location is a little sterile compared to the old spot, but it is too hard to pass up this delicious fare!"
Salsa Verde Restaurant,"First time here and everything was great. Everyone was nice, the restaurant was really clean, and the food came out quick. My wife is Hispanic so I know good Mexican food. Everything was delicious and the prices and portions were"
Salsa Verde Restaurant,"We have driven past this restaurant numerous times and have discussed stopping, but never did till today when we had to be in the center anyway. Wish we had been in the center sooner!

They have a nice patio area and serve alcohol so that already earns them a star. Large menu with salads, soups, burritos, tacos, entrees and an item called machete which is basically like an arepa. 

They also have a salsa bar with numerous options - salsa, avocado cream, cilantro cream, Southwestern dressing, pickled onions and veggies, cabbage, cucumbers and more. 

You order at counter but they bring food to you, fairly quickly. Good portion sizes and food is very flavorful"
Ensenada Street Food,Friendly and helpful staff. The birria is delicious. Super tasty tacos. The spicy salsa was excellent.
Seis Kitchen,"So DANG good!!!! Definitely get a side of rice, it was delicious! The tacos were great too. Everything was very flavorful and they have a decent amount of options for everyone. I kept coming back for takeout and it might be one of my new favorite places."
El Chinito Gordo,Nice atmosphere. Good food. Highly enjoyed the Paloma. Big plates of food barely finished
Salsa Verde Restaurant,"Based on the reviews posted here we thought we'd try this restaurant out. Well, the reviews are right on the money. The food is great. The staff is extremely friendly. We had a great meal. The food seemed to be a bit more ""authentic Mexican"" than most typical Mexican restaurants. You can't go wrong eating here!!!"
Guadalajara Original Grill,"From out of town and decided to go to this restaurant! 

The decor is so pretty! Very traditional and welcoming! 
The food is nothing short of Delicious!  The salsa is made fresh and so good!"
Seis Kitchen,"Outstanding, FRESH menu. Tomatillo salsa is to die for! Highly recommend."
Ensenada Street Food,Tacos were on point and the service was quick! The people who work there are really nice too!
The Garage on 4th,"We came here during the 4th avenue street fair. They were super nice and had a great patio. Beer selection was good and our burgers were AMAZING. We have an 8 month old baby and he loved being outside.  Staff were great with him and we left really happy with the whole experience. There are a lot of places down the street that are not super family friendly, or part of chains, this was different. We will absolutely come back and enjoy the weather while it lasts!"
El Chinito Gordo,Wow on those Margaritas! They hand-make them and they do not taste like sweet and sour. SO DELICIOUS!. Ally and Mo were awesome!
Ensenada Street Food,"Great food and friendly service. There was a little bit of a wait for the food I ordered, but it was well worth it! Delicious, and presented beautifully. Very vegan friendly!"
Salsa Verde Restaurant,"Went through drive through,  the guy at the window was very pleasant and the food was great as well. I'll be back"
Viva Burrito,"Not sure why other reviews are so low. The place is really clean and tidy, very nice staff and quick service. Delicious breakfast burritos, just like the east side location. I had the chorizo, potato and egg breakfast burrito, and was able to get salsa verde on request. Great prices! You can't ho wrong here"
El Charro Cafe,This is by far the best Mexican food. It has fresh and sustainable ingredients. The dishes are palatable and visually appealing. World class food in an old house. The owner is friendly and welcoming! Love this and recommend it to anyone traveling!
Rosa's Mexican Food Restaurant,"The enchiladas give me cravings that can only be satisfied by a trip to Tucson. Oh, my, yes!"
Crossroads Restaurant,"I cannot say enough good things about this place!!!

Tasty drinks
Beyond amazing food. Everything had so much flavor. 
The staff are very friendly
Cute atmosphere

Do yourself a favor and go check this place out. You won't be let down!"
BK Tacos,The Carne Asada and Pollo Tacos were OUTSTANDING!  The meats were marinated and grilled to perfection!  They feature a nice selection of fruit flavored waters at BK that complimented the food nicely. My colleagues each enjoyed their meals as well.
Papa Locos Tacos and Burgers,Been to the Broadway and Pantano location twice now. Their chili relleno burrito is amazing. I've had it with the red enchilada sauce and without. Both were good but I think I liked it better without the sauce. Also I added refried beans inside the burrito and it took it to the next level of deliciousness. Next item on my list is the chili relleno burger and I can't wait!
The Quesadillas,"A small family-owned restaurant with geat, reasonably priced food. It isn't fancy, but soooo good!  The quesadillas are filled with tasty grilled meat - not cheese-based, like so many."
The Quesadillas,"I've been here a couple times, and each time I think ""I need to come here more often"".  The food is delicious, from the moment one walks in the doors the smells are captivating, and the service is friendly and helpful.  I'm happily going again, as soon as I can get there."
The Quesadillas,"Almost passed on this place because of the 1 review with 2 stars.  That would have been a mistake

Like other posts say, Don't judge the outside.  This place is very clean on the inside and comfortable. Split a Carne Asada Quesadilla which comes with a bean taco and a side bean taco. Under 8.00 and we were both full.

This place is as good as all the 5 stars say it is.  The 2 people working were very friendly too."
Casa Sanchez-Mom's Mexican Food,Good food! Great prices! Fast Service! Always a selection of daily specials too.
BK Tacos,"One of the best hotdog place in Tucson and this is actually a sit-down restaurant. We love their Sonoran dogs, carmelos and burros. Their salsa bar is delicious, always stocked and clean. Must-visit."
La Bocanitas,Don't let the storefront fool you! The inside is super clean and modern and the food was excellent! Shrimp empanadas were delicious!
El Charro Cafe,"Amazing.  That applies to the food, the service, the ambience, the decor...  I could keep going.   We were a party of three, and each of us was happy with our meals.   Our server, Devin (spelling is a guess) was efficient, friendly and welcoming.   Jesse gave us a tour of the restaurant ( there's more to it than appears from the street;  it has a remarkable history ).  All staff interacted with us and other tables very warmly.   We will be back."
El Molinito Restaurant,Love the shredded beef tacos and I only need one margarita....it is intense. Spicy salsa is yummy or go for the tomate....milder version.
GRINGO grill + cantina,"Being previously acquainted with Miguel's, I was impressed by simply walking into the renovated Gringo Grill and Cantina. The remodeling of the restaurant was refreshing with an overall new look and feel to it. Their patio now has misters which makes the view of Tucson that much better! 
Off the cocktail menu, I ordered the Gila Monster. It was a nice combination of prickly pear fruit, cilantro, and tequila. I would definitely recommend this cocktail if you like sweet with a little twist! They also had so many creative cocktails that I look forward to trying in the future.
Randy and Gabi were both at the bar, they were extremely welcoming and informative about the Gringo menu. They both recommended the Sonoran Burger as one of their favorite food items on the menu. Of course, I had to give it a go. The sauce had a very nice sweet jalapeno taste to it. I decided to order tostones instead of the fries and they were delicious! 
If you are up for the challenge, the Desert Ghost is a must. While dining, someone actually finished their drink- they were rewarded with dinner for two and a free t-shirt! Overall, I was extremely happy with my experience at Gringo and I will definitely be coming back to try more of the menu!"
Illegal Pete's - Tucson,"Illegal Petes is exactly what university needed! Thank you for making your way down here with the amazing happy hour deals and queso smothered burritos! If you haven't been here you need to make it, great beer selection and great margaritas as well!"
Casa Sanchez-Mom's Mexican Food,"Great lunch, good prices. Fish tacos were awesome."
El Molinito Restaurant,"We usually go to the location on Ina & Thornydale and get taken care of really well. Our server was extremely nice and helpful. We went during lunch, so my friend had the chicken enchiladas and I had the Chicken Colorado with white sauce. But the one thing that stood out for me was the Pico De Gallo they make with roasted green chiles. That was the best Pico De Gallo I've ever tasted in my life, hands down. I love Pico De Gallo and have tried it many ways, but this takes the cake. I guess my addiction to green chiles helps that but I gotta say, you should try it. 

The prices here are affordable, the food is great and the service is too. I will be going back soon!"
El Charro Cafe,"Great experience! Nothing better than sitting outside in the middle of November on a Saturday afternoon watching the University of Arizona beat the pants off of Utah and enjoying margaritas and great food with our guest from Germany. I highly recommend the Carne Seca, while my wife enjoyed her chile rellenos and our guest had chicken enchiladas. Service was great and we were greeted at the door and seated immediately. Don't miss this great dining experience!"
El Molinito Restaurant,"Go there! Excellent food, good portions, good price, excellent service. A great value!"
Reforma Modern Mexican Mezcal + Tequila,I reserved the party room and they were able to give us a brunch menu for Saturday morning for my party. The customer service was exceptional and the food was great. The people I invited are hard to please and they loved the venue and food. Will be using them again for any big parties coming  up in the future. Thank you!!
GRINGO grill + cantina,"I ordered the Calabasitas Stuffed Chile Relleno with Shrimp. The menu indicated it would be spicy. It was not but it didn't matter because the flavor was there. Very well presented dish. The dish has red chile in it so ask for tortillas to sop up the goodness. The waitress (I unfortunately forgot her name but ticket said Erin) was busy but tended to all my needs and was very friendly. I only had this one dish but if the other dishes are as good, I would come back."
El Charro Cafe,The steak tampiquena with all the fixings was out of this world delicious.  The salsa is soooooo good and the service was excellent. Can't wait to go back again but it's a long way from OR
The Quesadillas,This will be the greatest quesadilla you will have in your life. The steak in it was very high quality (I would have eaten it as just a steak) and he tortilla is delicious. Furthermore the salsa bar is awesome with lots of great toppings to try. Will return!
El Charro Cafe,"If you are looking for an authentic Mexican food experience that is a little different from the other AZ styles, this is the place!!  The carne seca (spelling??) is out of this world and as far as I know, you cannot get carne seca in Phoenix... its a Tucson thing.  This historic restaurant seats a bunch, and it can be awkward, but its so popular that having tight seating allows for more of us to enjoy the food!  I'd rather be seated and served, than wait an hour.  The margaritas are great and the flan is dense but smooooothhhh.  Top recommend when you're in Tucson, from this Phoenician!"
Reforma Modern Mexican Mezcal + Tequila,"Wonderful! Most tender, delicious carne asada I've ever had, street corn was delicious (albeit not exactly traditional), and service was especially good considering it was opening night! Next time, I hope to set up a designated driver so I can try one of the fresh muddled margaritas of the day. Oh, and the place looks GORGEOUS!!! I'll definitely be back :)"
El Charro Cafe,"Best Bar downtown.  Happy Hour is great.  Service and Food are great!  And Staff are Top Notch.  Jerry, Robert & Johan make you feel at home every time .  Thank you El Charro!"
The Quesadillas,Wholly smokes this is good! I recommend going mid afternoon or later when the meat seems fresh from the grill but the prices are great and the tacos are the best around. I have yet to get beyond the first thing on the menu because it is that good. Took a bite of wife's veggie tacos which were superb and also bite of friends hot dog also outstanding!
El Charro Cafe,Quality you can taste! Enchilada banderas wasrecommended to us and was an excellent choice. The service was great as well.
Papa Locos Tacos and Burgers,Fantastic carnitas tacos! They are essentially in a gas station and easy to find. I also had a shredded beef enchilada which was pretty good. If I'm ever back I will definitely get several carnitas tacos!
Blue Willow Restaurant & Gift Shop,"I recently read an article that said you usually only eat at 5 restaurants, I know us Yelpers are different, but then I looked at my habits and it's true. So today I wanted to step outside of my 5 and try someplace new. So I went on Yelp and found a new place, force there, pulled into the parking lot of a closed restaurant. My wife jumped on Yelp and found the Blue Willow. 

I am very pleased with my experience. First and foremost was how attentive the waitstaff was. By the time we sat down we had menus and our drink order was in. As we porous the menu another came over and asked if we had any questions , and a third stopped by to make sure we had our drink order in. 

I ordered my breakfast staple of eggs, bacon and potatoes. This is a barometer as to how a breakfast restaurant is. My eggs were absolutely wonderful, perfectly fluffy and well seasoned, the potatoes were just as good and bacon.

Our server was very nice and personable, we talked about our similar soft bacon preferences. They insured that our tea water was filled and hot. Great guest service all the way around."
BK Tacos,"Favorite place to go for Sonoran dogs. Always great. May take a little while, but it's definitely well worth the wait. Always kind people working as well. Great staff"
"Guadalajara Grill - Mexican, Best Mexican Restaurant in Tucson","It seems that all of the hype I've heard about this restaurant is correct ... very much so! The design and decor of the restaurant is beautiful and authentically Mexican. It's fun just being there! The service from the entrance to our waiter and beyond was also impeccable and very much appreciated. The food, oh, well, yum! From the deliciously cilantro-rich table-side salsa to the guacamole to the bacon-wrapped shrimp to the Burrito Grande to their huge salads to their Mexican Paella to their Queso Lobster-stuffed Salmon, well, we were freakin' stuff by the time we headed out the door. Also, the serving sizes are quite generous and the prices are very reasonable. It's all just very well done at Guadalajara and it is a gem of Tucson. If you enjoy Mexican food, great service, and delicious food, then go there and go there often. You'll be glad you did."
El Torero,"WOW WOW WOW ~ super gem of a restaurant!! I went with a group of friends and we had an amazing night.  We spent about 3 hours there and loved every minute!  The co-owner Michael is an amazing chef and restauranteur!  Service was great and the food was delicious!! I believe the ""official"" opening is coming soon but they are open for business now!  Michael and his father are the same owners of Lerua's that sadly closed...

We started with the Loca Crisp (carne seca, Green Chile, guacamole and green onions). The carne seca was hands down the best I have ever had! Super moist and the flavor was out of town!!! Then he recommended we try the Carnitas crisp and that didn't disappoint either (cider braised carnitas, jack cheese, green onion, cilantro, avocado and queso fresco cream).  

There was also complementary chips and salsa which came with two different salsa.  Which were both really tasty.  I really enjoyed the chunky salsa Fresca the most which had hatch green chilis that gave it such a great flavor!! 

We all ordered something different from the menu so that we could sample lots of yumminess!! 

I ordered calabacitas which came with a green corn tamale.  It was one of the best tamales I've had for sure.  (I was torn between the calabacitas and the FLAT enchiladas ~ which I will def order next time) 

We also ordered the shrimp taco special, which came with a delicious chipotle pear/apple and a griddled cheese and corn tortilla shell.  Spices were on point and Had a great kick to it for sure.  

The next entree we ordered were the potato flautas which was modified for my friend by request to add mole.  HOLY MOLE!!! It was DELICIOUS!  It had such a depth in flavor that it changed my view on mole forever and was hands down my favorite dish out of all that we ordered!  

We finished off our evening by sampling all of the desserts.  Oh my gawd were they tasty!!!  They are all homemade in house and have a rotating menu.  The barrio bread pudding was to die for and my favorite.  It had chunks of apples and pears and was covered with a sweet sangria sauce and whipped cream.  We also tried the key lime pie which came in a shot glass and the dark chocolate and peanut butter mousse which were just decadent.  The last dessert we tried was the warm baked apples and pears with a cinnamon and brown sugar crumbles and was drizzled with a sweet simple syrup, which was yummy as well.  

I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and I can't wait to go back to try the flat enchiladas and to see what different specials they have!!!"
Sahuaro Cafe,People and food are wonderful. Nice bright place to eat. The servers and kitchen staff are delightful.
El Charro Cafe,Excellent food and service. The carne seca is one of my favorites. The enchiladas are a great way to sample flavors as you can get 2 different types. The sauces and guacamole are fresh and delicious. Drinks we had were prickly pear margaritas- perfect to have on the front patio. Despite the cov19 El Charro is still delivering excellent food and service to customers. Thank you!
Rosa's Mexican Food Restaurant,If you like home cook styled mexican food you'll love Rosas. Even when packed after a U of A game or on a cool saturday night you'll be served promptly. Located fairly central in town Rosas is a tasty family owned restaurant where you can get a lot of bang for your buck.
La Fuente,"I don't know why this place isn't more popular. I came here with a group for my friend's birthday, we were all doing the all you can eat brunch and mimosas. The food is second to none. The mole, salsas, tamales, pulled pork, etc was all delicious and authentic. The mimosas were made with cheap champagne but that is easily compensated for with the fact that you can have as many as you want. The mariachi band came out, play great music and even did a happy birthday for my friend. I plan on coming here again. They also accept Amex which few places do."
Illegal Pete's - Tucson,if i could give this place 20 stars i would!!!! zach the manager was so nice!!! john and eddie the bartenders are also very friendly with great customer service! this is the best place to get a quick bite to eat and a beer/margarita!!! definitely recommend
El Molinito Restaurant,A favorite of mine for lunch specials before 2pm. Friendly staff large dining rooms no waiting. Great refried beans & more!
Anita Street Market,"This place has changed my mind about who has the best tortillas in the universe:  let there be no doubt, Anita Street does!  We got there and they were out but told us they'd make some while we waited. What great service. 

I will be back. So so so good. 

Oh, we had a carne seca burro too. It was great."
"Guadalajara Grill - Mexican, Best Mexican Restaurant in Tucson","5 stars always. I love Guadalajara! I take anyone who visits tucson here--always great service, amazing table side salsa, food is , and margaritas are strong. Always a great time and will forever return!"
Reforma Modern Mexican Mezcal + Tequila,Food spectacular!!!! Service....Patrick was hilariously awesome!!!! Outdoor patio with mist..YES!!! Drinks sooooooooo many yummy choices!!! I wish I didn't live so far away or else I would go 2 times a week!!!
El Charro Cafe,"We spent a long weekend in Tucson and heard great things about the food and history of El Charro Cafe. 
Our experience was wonderful. Caleb and Marques took exceptional care of us all. We each had specific tastes and requests that were accommodated. Marques even helped us understand the history of a beautiful painting near our table. 
Our food was delicious! We had the natural margaritas and classic sangria. We recommend both. The tamales were a big hit with all of us as well. 
Thanks Caleb and Marques for the great service."
El Charro Cafe,Excellent food.  The carne asada is very good.  I particularly enjoyed my enchilada and Chile relleno too.
El Torero,"Sadly we no longer live in Tucson but when we do get back this is our number one go to place for the best Mexican food in town. Start with a cheese crisp, move on to a Carne Seca Chimichanga, and or green corn tamales when they are in season. Thirty four years of loving this place. Miss Ramon!"
GRINGO grill + cantina,Food is amazing! The service is even better.. super professional and friendly staff. I was having such a bad day and when I left there it was like nothing had ever happened! Manager came out and introduced himself and was super professional! Highly recommend!
Jason's Mexican Restaurant,"Love this place. The taco truck is the best in town in my opinion. Glad to see they expanded into a restaurant. Their California burrito is my go to, but instead of carne asada I get chicken. Their salsa has a nice kick to it and their tacos on a corn tortilla, mmmmm! Full of flavor."
Elvira's,"Opening night walk in got seated right away order a mojito but had to change order due to the bar not having mint. Waitress recommended mango margarita so order that instead and it wasn't all that great ( couldn't taste the tequila just the mango juice ). Order the steak molcajete and waited for over a hour (waitress did apologize ) but I had to cancel the order and go eat elsewhere. So I paid for the mango juice and left hungry, I will give it another chance the food did smell good. 


Finally made it back to give it another try and the food was amazing as well as the drinks. New mixologist Eric made up for the past experience. Definitely come in ask him for a drink."
El Patio,"I've been using this restaurant for four years now so I think I know it pretty well. Basically the food, ESPECIALLY THE CHICKEN FAJITAS (I dare you to NOT have leftovers), is always good...consistently good. The downside is the crappy atmosphere- think Denny's. During these times I use takeout now only but I do see them spacing folks out, the ventilation seems good and masks are used by all staff."
El Charro Cafe,Awesome food! Really fresh! So glad they had a large gluten free menu for my daughter!  Our waiter Lorenzo gave us great service! Will definitely come back!!!! I give it 2 thumbs up!
"Guadalajara Grill - Mexican, Best Mexican Restaurant in Tucson","My son loved it!  ""Dad, this will be a tradition every time we come back to Tucson"".  He's 8 and ordered toe full ""Maximo"" combo fajitas.  Delicious.  He also ate almost an entire bowl of the fresh table-side made salsa himself.  ""I can't stop eating it,"" he said.  

Everything is fresh.  The portions are ample and the service is friendly, quick and attentive.  

It's been a long-time favorite of mine and now my son is hooked."
El Charro Cafe,"Thank you Deme for the kindness you share with us all year long. You have a great restaurant & staff. Mickey proud of you your a great new server , bueno Suerte !  Also thank you chef Cruz. New pics of the USA carne seca chimi !     



Great carne seca USA chimi with refried beans guacamole sour cream & salsa Fresca on long platter impressive presentation & consistently delicious ! Wonder cheese crisp Yelp starter & great flan tambien ! Thank you Bree & Ivan for your great service & kindness ."
"Guadalajara Grill - Mexican, Best Mexican Restaurant in Tucson","This place is amazing! I've been to one other location, and I don't think they compare to the original!!! No matter what you order it's delicious!! I highly recommend going! Date night, or any night! Celebration? Graduation? Any occasion? Go! 

P.s. I got the virgin margarita, whatasteal for only $3.50! I enjoyed it for a few reasons, first being it wasn't super sugary. Secondly, it was served in a pint  glass, not a margarita glass so it's distinct from the other margaritas on the table, but it was still served with salt on the rim, which I enjoyed. To top it off, thirdly, it didn't melt!!! So I could sip my ""frozen margarita"" while my husband drank his as we celebrated new of our (first) pregnancy over dinner at Guadalajara! 
Thank you Guadalajara!!"
The Quesadillas,"After moving to Tucson from California,  I didnt have much luck finding the RIGHT spot to satisfy my soul.  Well...tonight we found it!  I had such a great dinner and experience here!  Amazing food, tasted like a little place I ate it in college.  We will be back!"
El Charro Cafe,"Last night's experience at El Charro was exceptional. My friends and I met up for an early dinner and were lucky enough to have Johan as our waiter. This young man has phenomenal customer service skills. He is calm, never flustered and treats every customer well.

The only happy hour margarita offered is the house margarita and despite us correcting her a time or two, S kept telling Johan she wanted a peach happy hour margarita. Rather than correct her once again - she truly didn't get it; she wasn't trying to be difficult - Johan told her he'd bring her a peach margarita and it would be their secret on the pricing. Class act, right there.

We shared guacamole, chips and salsa while we waited for our food and enjoyed some girl talk. When our food came out, we noticed how much care was taken to plate each dish beautifully. I've been to El Charro many times over the years and do not remember such detail. I was impressed. I ordered the Pescado Tropical and it was just gorgeous. My plate was divided in quarters, somewhat like a bento box and the sections contained charro beans, a green salad with a wonderful vinaigrette, calabacitas and my fish which was served over rice. Everything was outstanding and I will surely order the Pescado Tropical again.

El Charro is charming, historical and a fun place to enjoy a good meal."
La Placita Cafe,"Great food at a reasonable price. The chicken fajitas are the best I've had. Great service in a clean, pleasant setting."
Papa Locos Tacos and Burgers,"Fabulous and to die for! Green enchilada sauce - you certainly don't see that very often. The condiment/salsa bar is the best I've ever seen. Three different hot salsas, one made with chiles and soy sauce which was great and totally unusual. Pickled onions, cabbage with oregano, all yummy and exceptional flavors with every one of the six different salsas. Fish tacos are not fried like every place else in town, tender and succulent. Best enchiladas I've ever had, one chicken and one shredded beef. You have to go here! Best Mexican in Tucson. Don't let the gas station ambiance throw you off!"
El Charro Cafe,"We drove down from Phoenix just to eat here. We were not disappointed! We tried probably six different types of meat entrées but the mole was our favorite by far! The carne asada chimichanga and the albondigas soup were also great. Dominic hooked us up and we got to try the chicken tinga, charro beef birria and carne colorado, all three of which we would put up with the mole and eat a whole plate. Thanks! We will be back!"
Pollo Feliz,"Pollo Feliz offers great grilled chicken, and it's one of the best food bargains in town.

We love to go on Wednesday for the family meal special, a whole chicken and a half, an order of tortillas (your choice of flour or corn), beans and rice, plus a very simple salad of iceberg lettuce and tomato, which we usually skip in favor of an extra order of beans or rice. A cup of tasty fresh pico de gallo, and a smaller cup of a thinner salsa dressing round out the meal.

The tender chicken is juicy and flavorful, fresh from a marinade that is salty and citrusy and smoky from the wood grill. The beans are really awesome, juicy and not too spicy, with bits of ham throughout for extra flavor. The rice is pretty average, but it makes a nice bed for your chicken and is that much better after soaking up the juices. Their flour tortillas are tasty and thin; my only complaint with them is that while they are great hot, they end up hard and stiff as soon as they cool off. (Can this be the result of a microwave?)

There are many other choices in addition to a full chicken meal, though we have barely cracked the surface. The chicken tacos are good, the chicken quesadillas are great (good luck trying to make it home without tearing a piece off a quesadilla while you're driving), though I didn't find the tamales to be anything really special. But I'm sure willing to give them another try!

The drive-through staff is always friendly and efficient, and patient about my usual substitutions. I highly recommend Pollo Feliz for a fast food meal that puts the usual fast food to shame!"
Papa Locos Tacos and Burgers,"Don't judge a book by its cover, and don't judge a Mexican restaurant by its building. That's a difficult request to make when you pull into the parking lot and see a structure shared by Papa Locos, a gas station convenience store, and a barber shop. Once you get over your initial skepticism, you step inside and you're transported to a place serving up some of the best Mexican food Tucson has to offer. Not only that, but the interior of the restaurant is actually spotless---the staff clearly takes pride in the food and the upkeep of the place.

The standout menu item at Papa Locos is the fish burrito. If you like fish tacos, you'll love the fish burrito. The fish, which is grilled instead of fried, is always tender and perfectly-seasoned, and it's mixed with coleslaw, pico de gallo, lettuce, rice, and a spicy mayo. Inside a giant, chewy tortilla, the flavors blend together perfectly, and for a brief moment (until your head catches up with your stomach), you'll wish you had a second burrito after you finish the first one.

The California burrito and the fajita burrito are my two other favorite burritos. The California is simple, but incredibly filling: carne asada, cheese, French fries, and pico de gallo. The saltiness of the cheese is balanced out by the acidity of the pico de gallo, and the potatoes kind of soak up all the deliciousness. The fajita burrito with a generous portion of carne asada, grilled peppers and onions, and guacamole is exactly what you'd expect, so I won't elaborate on that.

The surprise menu item is the green chile cheeseburger, and it's quite possibly the best one you'll find outside of New Mexico. Roasted chiles, melted cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped onions and tomatoes, and spicy mayo sit atop a toasted bun with a hand-formed burger patty. The burger is so good that you forget that you're eating it at a Mexican restaurant in a gas station. 

All of the standard Mexican fare at Papa Locos is also tasty. I can personally vouch for the enchiladas (red is better than green), the chimichangas, and the tacos. I've somehow managed to not try any of the sandwiches or Sonoran hot dogs, but I've heard from co-workers that the Sonoran dogs are very good. Don't miss the full salsa bar (right next to the door) with 4-5 different salsas, pico de gallo, radishes, peppers, cilantro and onions, and lime wedges."
Plazita Mexico Cafe,"Amazing Mexican restaurant 
Always attentive 
Amazing food 
Chips are so good 
Hot chocolate, orange juice, coffee 
Breakfast tacos enchiladas"
The Quesadillas,WOW!!! What an awesome place to eat. Everything is homemade and tasty. The staff was so kind. When we asked for a suggestion they pulled out the stops and gave us the works. They aloud us to sample some new items that were so impressive. Highly recommend. And like others have said don't judge the book by the cover... the kitchen is spotless and the food is excellent!
El Charro Cafe,This is my absolute favorite place to eat when I'm visiting Tucson. The staff and the food are wonderful. The staff goes above and beyond for their guests.
El Patio,"We've been living in the area for over four years and have not eaten here until today.  I ordered a cheese enchilada with rice and beans and my husband got the bandera -- three types of enchiladas, beef, chicken, and spinach.  I enjoyed my meal and sampled my husband's too.  The spinach was a bit sweet which was unexpected, but all of our food was very good!  It's hard to find restaurants that serve spumoni so when I saw it on the menu I knew I wanted it.  When it came out, the serving was huge and it was very delicious!"
Lo Esencial,"Tucson, Marana, Oro Valley WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!  You're missing out if you haven't tried this Southwest gem.  Refreshing modern and ELEVATED Mexican food entirely made fresh from the chips to the entrees to the desserts!  Run, no sprint to try this excellent restaurant - you're gonna love it!!!"
El Charro Cafe,"My fiance and I just ate here yesterday, and we absolutely loved the food so much, we're going to have our wedding reception dinner here in December. We arrived during their ""happy hour"" and were able to get a great deal on a HUGE plate of nachos to try. 

The food was great. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and it was amazing. Just enough spice to feel the kick of the green sauce, but edible. Rice and beans as a side were good. My fiance had a bean and cheese chimi that he says was very good. The nachos that we had were huge, and we really liked the chips that were used. The salsa here is very tasty. We also ordered a mini-chimi sampler plate to try different flavors. It was to die for! 

The only concern was that the service was a little bit slow. Drinks were refilled, but not promptly. It was very busy, so hopefully it will be a bit better the next time we come."
Anita Street Market,"I remember going to Anita's for tortillas and empanadas as a little girl and I took a trip more recently and WOW. This is a Tucson must try. Delicious green chili tamales, tortillas, and empanadas. Everything is very affordable- you get very high quality authentic Mexican cuisine for the same prices as some local fast-Mexican food joints. The building is probably historic, and the restaurant is family owned. I love everything about this place."
The Quesadillas,"Always lived closed to The Quesadillas, but never tried it in the last few years, until last night. Was more than impressed with the food & staff. I ordered chicken tacos & a cheese quesadilla, and the manager was kind enough to bring me salsa that paired well with my food. They also gave us free chips while we waited. Can't wait to try some of their other options with my family. Great local vibes and freshly cooked food at a more than fair price. See you all soon"
The Quesadillas,"Got a carne asada quesadilla and taquito de frijol with Jamaica. Everything was DELICIOUS and 100% reminded me of living in Sonora. I will be back!! Sooo good. Quick service, clean, and Covid-friendly service."
Goyita's,"We've been here twice now on our visit to the Tucson area.  Both times we sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a lovely Mountain View. The first time the service was lacking, but the second time we had an excellent waiter. 
The food has been very good.  We've had the tostadas of all different types.  Most recently I got the shredded beef burrito Christmas style and it was excellent.  We also enjoyed the guacamole and chips appetizer.  I had the house margarita and she loved the mango margarita."
El Charro Cafe,Really great place for Mexican food. Nice indoor and outdoor seating! Great vibe and even better food!
The Quesadillas,"1 chicken bacon quesadilla (green chili, Mexican creme, bacon). 1 al pastor quesadilla. They each came with a bean soft shell taco. The flour tortillas are home made & you can definitely tell! Yum! This place is a great hole in the wall with awesome food, great people, great service!
The bean tacos are very good too."
The Quesadillas,COVID19 update: Quesadillas is still a 5 in mt book! Just read my previous review. None of that has changes. The Tortillas are fresh and the meat is flavorcity! Top takeout without a doubt.
El Charro Cafe,This place is great. Nothing I can add that hasn't already been said. I think the food is some of tastiest I've ever had.
BK Tacos,"I have always been on Team El Guero Canelo for as long as I can remember, and have never been to BK's until recently. This place is truly amazing! I will probably be coming here for now on to get my carne asada tacos whenever I am in Tucson. It sort of feels like cheating on your significant other with someone more appealing. Eeek...

The carne asada tacos are absolutely to die for, and the cart with all of the toppings had FRESH lime, cabbage and salsas and just about anything else you can put on your tacos. The dining area is also a lot cleaner than at Guero Canelo.

I think I just found a new main chick in BK' restaurant. El Guero Canelo's has just become the side chick... hahaha!"
Plazita Mexico Cafe,"Oh boy, I just found this place this morning! This is a lovely little find. Breakfast is reasonably priced. I remember when it was a corner café, and now it's even better. The staff are pleasant and sweet, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is awesome. If you want a good place for breakfast and a nice clean setting reasonably priced this is the place to go! You will not be disappointed. I plan on making it a regular breakfast place, the east side doesn't have too many places you can go that are good quality food good quality people good quality restaurant. I don't very often give 5 stars but this place deserves it. Like I said, I'm definitely going back."
Martin's Comida Chingona,"I was craving Martin's all day. After getting out from school and voting i went by Martins and he was outside he told me they were closed until later that evening. Without hesitation he offered to make me something to go! That was extremely nice of him and his tacos are delicious, my favorite in Tucson. All the food at Martin's is delicious and I love their salsa. Martin and his waitstaff is awesome. I specifically created this yelp account just to let people know how nice he is."
Crispy's Fish-n-Chips,Either I came when really Hungry but So far one of the best fish & chips in Tucson. Will defiantly be coming back. This place rocks!!
Poco & Mom's,"Great food and happy staff! They bring a positive attitude that brightens the ambiance of the restaurant. 
The food was wonderful. Strong and authentic  flavors make this place a must for all Mexican food lovers."
Blanco Tacos + Tequila,"Me and my husband were visiting out of town and took a friend here during busy dinner hour. The place was packed and the hostess promptly gather our info and we sat in the waiting area, which had plenty of sights to view while we waited. While waiting we noticed we were going to miss their happy hour if we didn't get seated quickly. My husband went and asked the hostess if we could still order off the happy hour menu. She asked the manager and he was more than happy to allow us to order off the menu. We got seated order our food and it was great! Tacos were small enough to fill you up and not feel stuffed the nachos were great! I think the team did a great job at keeping all the tables attended and drinks full. When the food came out we happen to get someone else's order and the check amount charged us full price on the drinks however the manager took off more than the happy hour amount which he didn't have to do but did! Other than those very small things we loved it and had a great experience!!"
Poco & Mom's,"This place is wonderful. I've been to the best of places throughout New Mexico, and Poco and Mom's easily rivals if not bests them. The green chili is incredible- good heat but very palatable. For a softer heat with wonderful texture, the sour cream green chili sauce is awesome. Oh, and the machaca is fantastic!"
Blanco Tacos + Tequila,"ok, this is not the best place for food, but it has good appetizers, good service and the view is lovely. Nothing better than not having to bother but just relax and that is what you can do there. We love the young waitstaff, very attentive and not stupid or snobbish, the food is always good although we restrict ourselves to easy appetizers, which they do well. The entrees are ok but nothing special. However, the appetizers are good, the service is good and leaves you alone, all in all it is more of an European ambience and the  view through the mirrors is divine. The place for us to go to relax, thank you. Good job giving us what we want, fast and good food and drinks, and then we are left alone! Love it! However, one bathroom for each gender? That is not enough and also
walking through the waitstaff to go to the restroom is not convenient."
Boca Tacos Y Tequila,Maria is a taco ninja... Best tacos in Tucson. Finding a seat can be challenging at times. Staff is friendly. Variety of salsas is amazing. They truly are hotter than your girlfriend.
Mexico In Season,Great food unique healthy Mexican. Wide selection of options.  Great green chili pork bowl and burritos.   I definitely will be going back soon.
Boca Tacos Y Tequila,Outstanding carne salad and burro.  I love the salsas that come with the meals. Good choice of beers too.
Poco & Mom's,Great place for breakfast and lunch. Service was fast and you get chips and salsa to munch on while you wait. Prices were cheap and staff was friendly. They have outdoor seating and were pet friendly.
Poco & Mom's,Place looks like a dive but the food is amazing. Price is exceptionally reasonable and the staff makes you feel like a long lost friend even if it's your first visit. You can't go wrong here but the hatch chili enchilada was fantastic.
Asadero y Taqueria Sonora,OMG!! This place needs to be on the map. Hands down best Mexican Food ever. Great service is a bonus. I heart heart this place. - Val Muldez
Chipotle Mexican Grill,"This location is my favorite Chipotle location. Every time I come to this location I get friendly service. A good portion of food and a warm inviting atmosphere. 

My favorite dish is the burrito bowel with a bed of lettuce, add a mix of both rices, then add some mixed vegetables add in some barbacoa with salsa fresco and a dab of the green chili's followed by some cheese and guacamole. Mmmm! So Delicious.. My favorite.! 

The chips are a nice addition (optional)"
Martin's Comida Chingona,"Came in not sure if this would be a good spot, but turned out to be a gem. Food is very good and freshly made when ordered."
Poco & Mom's,"love this place food is amazing and service rocks...carol a tall brunette was very friendly and informative...thanks for great suggestions .....love both locations and if they had a happy hour specials for drinks and appetizers or mini tacos,burros,cheese crisps i would bring my happy hour group here ...get a happy hour and a signature margarita or another signature  drink  please...your food is so awesome and the patio rocks as well"
Mosaic Cafe Dos,"I can't believe I've lived in Tucson for 10 plus years and never ate here in til today. Fresh tortillas made here and it's delicious. I eat it with there tasty salsa. Shrimp ceviche is made fresh as well, so it took 20 minutes , well worth it. I had chicken fajitas and it came with beans and zucchini and corn, so good. My  husband got the Chili con carne that he liked , and he also had a Michilada that he said was excellent! This place is now our favorite Mexican Restaurant. I can't wait to go back."
San Carlos Grill,"Very friendly service. Sat at bar. Bartender happily made me a margarita with fresh lime juice. I had the veggie enchiladas which were very good. My husband had the Alambre (spelling?) Tacos. Soft tacos with grilled steak, bacon, onions and peppers. They were awesome! The salsa is delicious and the chips were crispy and warm. We appreciated the side choice of chilaquiles as well."
Chipotle Mexican Grill,"Always good food.
Prior to this visit I slipped at the entrance. I bruised my palm and had swelling on the side of my knee. Thank god I have insurance.
I stopped visiting until today.. Or 6 mos later.
Food a still good"
Martin's Comida Chingona,"Delicious tacos made fresh to order. Awesome little dive joint. Definitely a cool spot to chill and have a beer, while enjoying some awesome Mexican food. Next time I am in AZ. I'm stopping in."
Blanco Tacos + Tequila,Blancos is consistently good. Great prices and large portions. We love coming here for lunch.
Sonoran Delights,Amazing service and raspados! Came here on a date with my man and it was wonderful. Hot day and cool inside
Mosaic Cafe Dos,"Surprised to see just 31/2 stars here . I love this place , the breakfasts here are second to none . Fresh made tortillas are made right in front of you and served warm . Great service positive friendly atmosphere and the enchiladas are absolutely delicious. I recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Mexican food for breakfast lunch or dinner they have it all . ;0)"
Fini's Landing,"My brother and his family eat here a lot, as it is close by their home and consistent in serving up good food. When we came the other evening (me for the first time) it was crowded and we were seated on their outdoor patio. Whew, that wasn't pleasant in the intense heat of an summer evening in Tucson. Our waitress promised to find us a table as soon as one became available and, sure enough, she soon came out to relocate us to a booth inside. Definitely better! 

This has the feel of a neighborhood bar/hang-out. It's a bit noisy in a friendly way. Not so much that we want to leave but enough that you notice the other people in your vicinity. I like that no one makes you feel like you gotta gobble up your food so the next group can be served. It's more a place where you can linger over your food and gab for awhile to pass the evening away. 

I really enjoyed the food here very much. My shrimp tacos were seasoned beautifully. The pinto beans were a tad on the spicy side (in a good way) and simply excellent. I tasted other foods such as my nieces' salmon and found it to also be excellent. Every single thing I tasted was something I'd happily order for myself. Even the seasoned fries were tasty. The portions were generous."
Boca Tacos Y Tequila,"The new location for Boca is awesome! It's spacious and comfortable and maintains quick service. The staff was very friendly and informative. One cool thing to note about boca is the vegetarian and vegan availability in addition to the variety of options with meat. I ordered two veggie tacos and a citrus-marinated salmon taco. They were very flavorful and really complimented by the four different salsas that were brought with them. Delicious food, sit at the bar for full service, or just order at the counter and keep to yourself. It's accommodating to everyone."
Chuy's Mesquite Broiler - AutoMall,"Everyone I know loves this place! It's a super laid back atmosphere and there's something on the menu for everyone. The prices are very reasonable, too. Chuy's is in the Tucson top 10 for sure."
Martin's Comida Chingona,"My first dining experience in Tucson.
I wasn't sure what to expect...I wanted a light meal and to sit outside amongst the festive Saturday night foot traffic.I walked in not knowing if it was table service or not, and perhaps annoyed the busy server (owner?). But despite that, he was still friendly, gave great service and quite a hearty, jovial character.

I had a carne asada burrito with greens. A little surprising for a restaurant that has ""vegetarian and vegan"" on the sign. But I didn't mind. I eat anything. While I often stick to vegetarian foods, I was in the mood for some beef. I have traveled Mexico, am a former chef and married to a Mexican...so I think that somewhat qualifies me to say...Perfecto! I wasn't very hungry, but couldn't stop eating! Served with cabbage and a basket of fresh chips and beans.

My husband always makes not-too-spicy ""gringo salsa"" for the guests and ""regular"" salsa for us.The salsa here was authentic, had the perfect taste and picante, but not too spicy. A little on the ""gringo"" side for salsa, but delicious. Clearly fresh. 

It is easy to distinguish authentic Mexican from not-so-authentic-canned-beans-and-canned-salsa Mexican. Well, it's easy for me. This is authentic. I cannot wait to try more! I will surely update....

Oh...and love the art!

Update:
2nd experience. Tried a medley of the tacos...Chicken Mole, Fish and carne asada. Five Stars again. Fresh grilled Tilapia and a perfect blend of flavors for the Mole. You really can't go wrong here...."
El Checo Mexican Food,"Great carne asada, great value!  Ordered two taco plates, a Sonoran dog, and a large caramelo.  $18.  The roll for the dog was a little saturated, but I chalk that up to taking it to go and not eating it on site.  Would definitely come back here and eat again.  Cash only!!"
Blanco Tacos + Tequila,"We had a fabulous dinner here. Made a rez online. Seated promptly. Our server was very attentive. I had the smashed watermelon marg - fabulous. We had the queso - it was good, kind of a ""bougee"" queso but still good. Chips and salsa were good. We all had tacos, I had the carne asada - fabulous. Definitely a hip, upper end mexican restaurant - so if you are looking for old fashioned trashy Mexican food (which I love too!!!) this isn't the spot. But highly recommend for this certain vibe. Will be back!"
Rancho Rustico Restaurant,"Great restaurant. Excellent service and good food. Had the house margarita, which was on special, and it was very good and well made. Definitely got our money's worth!"
Taco Giro,I was just there for dinner with my husband and I was so impressed! The service was fantastic! Food was great! Very clean. I'm so excited to go back again!
Sonoran Delights,"Stop in Sonoran Delights any night of the week and you will realize that it is the exact definition of neighborhood hangout. Barrio Hollywood/Menlo Park neighbors congregate here in the summer to enjoy a refreshing treat and catch up with each other. When I travel to other places, these are the kinds of places I want to find. The places where people come together and are happy, where the food is good and also representative of the place I am in. Sonoran Delights is that place for Tucson. Looking for a snack rec? Try the Macedonia, raspado, or grab 3 close friends and get a banana split. They are all Delightful!"
Boca Tacos Y Tequila,"I finally made it to Boca after rooting for Chef Maria all the way through Top Chef season 18.  I tried the Macho, Pollo, and Taco Dog tacos. They were all delicious. Service was fast and attentive."
Poco & Mom's,"I have a highly addictive habit when it comes to green chili. Having my aunt who's from New Mexico expose me to the beauty and originality of New Mexican food, I've found a soft spot for it in my gut. Welcome to the place that has an amazing understanding for authentic New Mexican food! There are few places I crave, but when it comes to this place I do readily visit. Try their breakfast- you'll be amazed at the portions and flavor."
Poco & Mom's,"As the previous poster said, as we sat down the waitress brought is the menus. Then when she came back she said ""Have you been here before?"" We said no. She said ""Well, are you adventurous or are you menu readers?"" That sounded like a direct challenge, so I replied, ""Oh, we are adventurous!"" She looked at me and said:
""Breakfast or Lunch? I said ""Breakfast.""
""Meat or veggie?"" 
""Pork. I like green chili.""
""How do you like your eggs?""
""Over easy.""

""Ok, now you..."" And she asked my boyfriend the same questions. She then took away our menus and left. Now the BF, from NC, is not very versed in traditional Mexican cuisine and I have to say, he had a true fear face happening. I assured him it would be ok, and we waited. 

When she came back, she delivered to me, the Sante Fe breakfast special! Wooo! Green hatch chilis are so awesome! Hashbrowns covered in the hatch green chilies, topped with red pork and a couple of fried eggs! Yum!!! 

He got breakfast quesadilla, green chili and beef. Yum!!! He was over the moon. 

We were there before the Gem Show and had all day to walk around, which we were mad about because we just wanted to beg out on the massive plates and hit a hammock somewhere. 

This place rocks and I am mad that I am two hours away. Go out of your way to get here. Do it."
Tio Will,"Omg! About time the put a good sports bar next to my house.  The food was good and the place was awesome.  Will be back and will recommend this place to all my friends. 

P.S. for the people complaining about the prices go during happy hour 2 to 5.  2 dollar tacos and .69 cent wings."
Gio Taco,"Excellent food. I had the Gio Taco and citrus chicken burrito. Yummy!!! The Gio Taco was small, just meat on a small tortilla. But wow the flavor of the smoked meat made up for it's size. The citrus chicken burrito was bountiful. Good size and stuffed til it almost broke open. But wait, I was talked into canteloup water. Not what I expected (thinking canteloup pieces floating in water). They some how got the juice from the canteloup and thinned it down to the consistency of water. It is fantastic (and maybe healthy for you). This will always be my drink. If you are downtown do yourself a huge favor stop in and treat yourself go some great food. Everyone from the cashier to Jose (one of the fantastic chefs) is super friendly."
Tucson Tamale Company,"Great food, great prices. Tamales were moist and I really enjoyed their guacamole. I had the sonoran and the jojo. It is a hole in the wall but sometimes that's where the best food comes from. Wish it was bigger or had more of a seating area but really liked the back patio."
Javelina Cantina,"Not sure why this place has poor reviews, I had one of their Mexican Mules and a chicken quesadilla and they were fantastic. The server was also easy to talk to and very attentive."
La Parrilla Suiza,"Food was wonderful! Great, Authentic Mexican food! The service was slow but the waiters were very nice. Great atmosphere!"
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Tucson - Reid Park,"Stayed Friday the 28th & Sat 29th.
Checking in . smooth.  Room ....very nice.  Room service ...excellent. Steak dinner ...excellent Surroundings ...excellent. Pool area very nice . Pool heated . Easy access to everything.  
Cute gift shop.  If should sell magazines & books though.
Will defiantly come back.Highly recommend. Everyone friendly & helpful."
Tucson Tamale Company,"We became addicted to these delicious tamales buying them frozen at Sprouts. Then, I stumbled across the actual store, where they are both cheaper and even more delicious plus yummy salsa.  My favorite is the JoJo and the vegan blue (I know, opposites do attract). And my husband loves the Wisconsin, Tucson and JoJo.  A must-try if you like tamales!"
The B-Line,"This place has all the elements needed to make a trendy spot for great Mexican food. Oftentimes there is a trade off between swank and authenticity when it comes to Mexican food, but this place does it right. The interior is adorable: multi-level with bar-height tables/seats, neat artwork along the walls, and various nooks. You order at the counter and there is an extensive beer, wine and food menu, as well as fresh pastries. 

The fish tacos were very good with well-paired flavors and condiments. I wasn't that excited that the bf ordered a bean and cheese burrito, but it was probably one of the best bean and cheese burritos I've ever had. We got half with red enchilada style sauce, half with green. It was perfection. Their rice and beans are also great. 
Happy hour every day from 4-6pm with $1 off pints."
The B-Line,"Even if you don't want an incredible breakfast, lunch or dinner - stop by for the best deserts in town!!"
Tucson Tamale Company,"Not only the best store bought tamales that I've found, but the only good ones I've ever found. Having had homemade tamales all my life, I have not once been impressed with tamales from a restaurant. They are either too dry or have barely any filling. So I went into this place very wary. But the tamales were beyond good. The masa was delicious and not dry at all. The filling (I had the Chile relleno, red Chile beef, and chipotle beef) were all delicious and not scarce. The beans and rice were delicious as well. Friendly and incredibly fast service to top it all off. If you too are wary of store bought tamales, give this place a try and you won't be disappointed."
Guadalajara Original Grill,"This is the best.  The food the service the music the total atmosphere 
There is not a plate that is below great. 
The bar is liberal pouring and great top shelf margaritas
The owner is available most evenings."
The B-Line,"If you are visiting Tucson and are looking for a place to eat that it somewhat easy on the wallet, GO to the B-LINE!   I came here once not knowing what to expect and I was blown out of the water.  No need to dress up, the B-Line is super casual.  The food is so fresh tasting as they make almost everything from scratch.  I've had the chicken quesadilla, the steak salad, and my personal favorite..the steak tacos.  SO yummy.  Happy hour at the B Line is very reasonable, $3 for a pint!  AND, the desserts are DIVINE, the chocolate Pot de Creme is absolutely amazing.  Go check it out!"
Guadalajara Original Grill,"Awesome food, including fresh homemade salsa at your table to your taste. Machacca beef is great as well."
Tucson Tamale Company,"Very casual. Walk in, pick up, put your own salsa on the tamales, sit down and enjoy immensely. There are a variety of meat, veggie, and vegan tamales to mix and match and three levels of hotness of salsas. Don't have enough room to try them all?  They have frozen ones to go!  Yummy one and all."
Mariscos Chihuahua,"The *affordable* Mexican seafood experience is often tainted by subpar quality, and more often than not, everything is kinda dirty tasting. Mariscos Chihuahua could have Outkast's ""So Fresh & So Clean"" as it's jingle if there weren't crazy fees for something like that. If offered, I am available to cover this song as a jingle in exchange for daily rations.

The shrimp culichi is worthy of doing semi-terrible things for. I get why the employee shirts advertise it. If offered, I am prepared to cut one into a man tank and wear it every day in exchange for daily rations. But, if you want to take the debauchery to an incorrigible level of debauch, putting the shrimp culichi atop a large fried fish is the way to go. Not saying I did that, just throwing it out there. Not saying I'd do it again, but I'm definitely going to."
Gio Taco,"I went to Gio Taco for the first time tonight! I've heard great things about them and it was all true! Great atmosphere, friendly staff & amazing food! 

I received my food very fast and everything was incredibly tasty. I usually order one thing from a menu, stick with it and never venture out but everything was so incredible that I want to try the rest of it to decide what will be my favorite! 

I love how you can order from a computer and pay up front. Makes it really convenient for me! 

Usually when a restaurant opens I give it a little time to work out the kinks but I've heard so much about it I had to go! They have it together and the staff is well trained & efficient! I will be back that's for sure! 

Say Hi to Anne(manager) when you go!!! She's so much fun and a pleasure to talk with!"
The B-Line,I love going here you have to time it just right so you do not get stuck in one of the massive lines that tend to form for the delicious food that is being served. however i usually never have to wait long after ordering and they have always been good with me about getting me my correct order. I love there crepe cakes they have always been delicious every time i eat here. The fruit is always extremely fresh as well and they give you a large variety. I have also had desert here and let me tell you they know what they are doing when it come to your sweet tooth. I had a chocolate strawberry cupcake with a chocolate cream cheese icing it was to die for i was in heaven until the last crumb was off the plate. I will be returning soon that is for sure!
The B-Line,"This place is an easy favorite for breakfast and lunch. I have been making this a weekend stop almost every every weekend. A quick dinner also makes sense since they do have beer available. The fish tacos are amazing and the steak burrito is, in my opinion, the best in Tucson. The portions are enough to fill me up but not push the boundaries of being stuffed. I find that B-Line is great for parties up to four.. Anything larger it will be hard to find a table."
Guadalajara Original Grill,"I had been to the  really 'old' location years ago. I'm not sure if this is the same  as it feels bigger but the salsas, guac,  were as good as I remembered. I had the tilapia (excellent) but the chile  relleno I saw come out of kitchen looked great. The mariachi and woman playing violin were wonderful. Very nice evening and a good place where one can sit at bar, still order a late dinner, hear good music and feel it was a pleasant dinner out and lunch for tomorrow."
The B-Line,"I love the B-Line!  For breakfast get a breakfast burrito, for lunch or dinner get the chicken tacos, and try to save room for dessert! Their desserts always look amazing. yum yum!"
Karamelo King,"After having a busy Saturday visiting Tucson, we stopped at Karamelo King to grab some food to bring home.  It was nearly 10pm so they weren't super busy but still had a few customers.  We decided to try a few different things off the menu.  First, we got the ""super nachos"".  They were smothered in melty gooey cheese and carne asada.  The flavor was awesome, although I don't recommend them for take out because the steam made the chips soggy.  I would definitely recommend them for eating there.   Then we got 2 tacos - hass and carne asada.  They were on thin flour tortillas that I thought would fall apart but they held up well and had a lot of flavor in the meat and in the tortilla.  The hass was the same but with green chiles.  Delicious.  We got a Sonoran dog, which I liked but my girlfriend thought was mediocre.  Personally I thought it was the best one I've had.  Last but NOT least - the Karamelo King itself.  What looks just like a quesadilla is filled with tons of flavor!  I highly recommend a karamelo and I will definitely be having another soon!"
Frank's,"I'd been in Tucson a little over three months and was actually on my way to The Blue Willow in my continuing search for ""my"" breakfast spot when I missed the turn from Tanque Verde onto Grant.  So I headed down Pima instead and figured I'd go ahead and take it all the way to Campbell just to see what there was to see.  Well, that had to have been the most fortuitous missed turn ever, because lo and behold I pass this hole-in-the-wall place whose patio is FULL at 8:30 on a weekday morning and I thought ""Whoa, Nellie!  Gotta see what Yelpers have to say about that place.""  Which I did while I ate my perfectly good, but nothing-to-get-excited-about meal at The Blue Willow.  

That was two weeks ago and I've been to Frank's twice now since.  The first time was last Wednesday and I ordered the special, which happens to be my very favorite breakfast - chicken fried steak and eggs, hashbrowns and toast.  Holy moley, I've FOUND it, I thought!  This is my place!!!  Generous portioned and freakin' fabulous chicken fried steak smothered in delectable gravy and perfectly - I mean PERFECTLY cooked hash browns.  

I went back today and had the huevos rancheros and again left feeling over-the-moon in love and absolutely thrilled I found this place.  It ain't much to look at (I love the sign out front!), but the food is all that matters and that they deliver in spades.  Oh, and the waitress remembered me!  That's always nice. :)"
Tucson Tamale Company,Best place ever!!! We would eat here daily if we could afford it and not gain 10000 pounds doing so
Tucson Tamale Company,"It obvious that Tucson Tamale Company makes killer delicious tamales, but that's not the reason for this 5-star rating. Their customer service seems to be just as amazing as their food. Just went in to grab a few tamales to go and the guy that helped me was super welcoming and made me feel like I was part of the family! Even the simple gesture of offering to fill up my iced tea just before I left on a hot day was appreciated. Go here, now. You won't regret it."
Guadalajara Original Grill,This is my favorite Guadalajara Grill since coming here back in 2003 the best food the best service the best Guadalajara Grill! The complementary tableside freshly prepared for you salsa is complementary and don't forget to tip the salsa girls you don't get this kind of salsa anywhere else in Tucson or that anywhere else for that matter! There's not a bad idea on the menu whatever captures your tastebuds attention is where your eyes should look and what your order should be the absolute best Mexican in Tucson Guadalajara Grill the original on Prince!!
Frank's,"I use to come here every Friday morning after my overnight 12-hour shift at the hospital. Frank's during the day is your classic vintage breakfast, the way your eggs, potatoes, and chorizo should taste like. I've had just about everything on the menu and it's all delicious comfort food. The ambiance makes it feel close to home, especially sitting at the bar. The waitresses and cooks work together effortlessly as they put in orders, oiling up the grill, and delivering the food on the table. I am always impressed with each visit. I always feel comfortable coming here to eat and I hope everyone else gets to dine in and enjoy the Frank's breakfast experience."
Guadalajara Original Grill,Just had lunch here for the first time. One of the best taco salads ever. I don't know how one person could finish it. Have to have the bean dip. Yummy.
Mariscos Chihuahua,Best in Tucson and even compared to some beach cities. As far as Mexican sea food goes.
Frank's,"OMFG!!

The placed was packed this afternoon as it always is on weekends, find yourself with good timing and get seated quickly at the bar, a table or in the outside patio area.

The purple laminated menu is chalk full of diner favorites. Eggs made to order and orders made to please. My sausage Biscuit and Egg sandwich was amazing. The right mix of light oil and flavorful meat made it a joy to have.

The house fries with onions, peppers, and well seasoned are a great compliment to this special. Add some salt, pepper and Tampico and you're in business. The house hot sauce is like minced salsa and a bit on the spicy and vinegar side, in a good way.

I'll be bringing everyone here as often as I can.

For a great diner experience, tasty food and favorable prices this is the place :)"
Guadalajara Original Grill,"Salsa cart table side need I say more? Ok this place moved from its last location that provided the diner with an outdoor experience. What this new location provided however is the extra footage that is great for big parties.
The service is attentive and friendly.
The food? EVERYTHING is  great!!  One of the best places to go for a nice mexican sit down meal.  The salsa they make is perfect as you direct the lady that makes it exactly to your taste buds.  Be prepared to wait but it worth check the place out."
Cafe Santa Rosa,"One of my favorite breakfast spots in town! The BEST house-made chorizo and red chile beef, well-cooked eggs, and the creamiest beans. Food is comforting and delicious and the service is superb. The ambience is another draw - super cute barrio feel with beautiful architecture, window light, and fresh flowers on each table. Highly recommended."
Tucson Tamale Company,"on a recent trip i met the owner of this fabulous restatuarant on the plane.  I love to be able to support a small business owner.... even better when they are the best tamales I have had since my aunt's house.

We were travelling with a group of 15+ students and staff from UC Davis and ordered a variety of the tamales vegatarian and meat like... EVERYONE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED!  That is a lot to say for such a large group.  The beans were amazing and the salsas were equally awesome!

I don't have many reasons (actually none) to return to Tucson but if I ever did I would make a special trip here... thank goodness they also ship tamales to 50 states!!!!  I have to plan an order!

AMAZING!"
Tucson Tamale Company,"We first met Mr. Martin at the Rincon Farmer's Market. My husband was being a sort of pest asking for samples (assuming that every single place offers them). Mr. Martin gave us a whole tamal(e). I hope it was in a ""here, shut up"" sort of way, but I think he was really just being nice. That first one we tasted was The Arizona (beef and chipotle peppers) and we were sold at first bite. We bought like 10 million tamales right there. OK, it was more like 8. 
Now, I grew up in a family where my grandma would make tamales each Christmas. Later we had a neighbor who would make and sell tamales each Friday. What I'm trying to say is that I'd been tamale-jaded for a while. I thought I'd had them all (red, green, pork or chicken) and just didn't think I'd be impressed by a tamal(e). 
I was wrong. How could I have known that there were soooooo many other kind of tamales other than the usual grandma kind (don't worry, my grandma doesn't Yelp). They offer vegan tamales, meat tamales, spicy tamales and all are delicious! I think my now I've tried them all. My favorite is still the Arizona with the Sonora (chicken and green chiles with extra yummy) as a close second. If you can't make it out to the Broadway location, you can find them at the St. Phillips Farmers Market on weekends. Nom, nom, nom!
SImplify, Sustain, and Celebrate!"
The B-Line,"My favorite breakfast place! Prices are a little high for what you get, but their coffee and food is amazing"
Karamelo King,Best late night food in town. So happy to hear they're opening a restaurant in the area as well.
Frank's,Love this place!  A little hole in the wall that serves the best breakfast!  Staff are so friendly.  Always busy.  Don't get dressed up.  Shorts and t-shirts are the appropriate attire.
Mariscos Chihuahua,Outstanding food and service! Will gladly return again! Got the fried fish and it was as good as the pictures suggested.
Los Nopales Mexican Restaurant,"A great place for Mexican Food. It's a true hole-in-the-wall, but don't let that keep you away!
Favorites:
Chicken & Rice Soup
Flat Enchiladas w/Machaca
Cheese Crisp
...anything with green sauce!

The menu even includes vegetarian items."
Guadalajara Original Grill,"It is great ""Americanized""  Mexican food.  Everything tastes great, but you can share a lot of entrees.  We normally split a Veggie Molcajete.  The margaritas and salsa are great too!!   Great for family visits and fun nights!"
Guadalajara Original Grill,"Some people have told me that this place is always packed, no matter what time you go. I busted that myth last night, as me and the girlfriend showed up at 5:30pm on a Monday night. What better time can you go, right? Right. There were plenty of people there, but the restaurant is huge so we got seated immediately. 

Ended up getting the hot salsa mix from the nice lady, wasn't too hot though. Probably the only bummer of the night. I ordered the chimi asada, my lord it was delicious. Girlfriend got the shrimp burrito with some type of southwest sauce on it. Let's just say I will be ordering what she had next time I go. No room for dessert, the portions were huge. 

Pros: Waitress we had was awesome, the meal was excellent, not too busy at 530 on a monday evening

Cons: Uhhhh... just the salsa not being hot enough I suppose? 


GO HERE YOU WILL LOVE IT. WELL, PROBABLY."
Los Nopales Mexican Restaurant,"Coming back from Old Tucson and found this little gem. Do not judge a book by its cover. Very nice folks, outstanding food, great variety of both traditional and healthy offerings.. Very quick food delivery. They know what they are doing."
Paradise Aqua Frescas,Giving 5 stars for the Horchata! It's a house recipe and delicious! 2nd floor near Forever 21. The raspado is yummy too! Haven't tried the food tho
Percheron,"I'm making my way through all the 12th ave eateries. First stop Percheron. Yes I have been here before, but needed a fresh experience to post my review. This place doesn't disappoint it's great. I had the Percheron Sonoran style. Like the regular Percheron but with bacon inside the burro. My family tagged along, my son got the bacon wrapped very delicious, not greasy at all. One of my daughters got the vegetarian she liked a lot. Another for the grosero that's adobo steak with cheese and veggies. My wife got the mexicano like the Percheron except it has the poco de Gallo salsa. What makes this burros exceptional is the tortilllas. They are the best. I'm adding some pictures of the Percheron and my son biting on a bacon wrapped. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for the best burros in town, not a lot place to sit...but who cares when the place is delicious."
Tucson Tamale Company,"This place has truly done a 180. Their restaurant has a whole new look, it's much cleaner, the workers are much friendlier, and the tamales are delicious. This is a new favorite place of mine to grab tamales, and I'd definitely recommend this place for some tasty gourmet tamales."
Frank's,"The food at Franks will likely give me a coronary someday but when that day comes, I will move on to the next world in a happy state and smile down on the Earth, hopefully with a heaping stack of buttery, soft and warm pancakes, bacon and eggs over-medium to my side. Great food, killer service, entirely reasonable prices. Been going here a dozen years and intend for another three dozen."
Rubio's,Food is consistently great! Staff is friendly and it is always clean! Happy customer :)
Mariscos Chihuahua,"We drove from Phoenix for Mexican food. Doesn't look very inviting from outside, but the inside is a totally different story. Warm atmosphere and very friendly staff. The food was a 10.  We ordered Culichi shrimp, plancha shrimp, bacon wrapped shrimp, and fish filet al ajo. They were all finger licking good. We left nothing to go, and we all ate a little bit of each others. Probably the best Mexican food we've had in many years, and at a quality standard above the rest. Very original. Very much worth the 3 hr round trip from Phoenix. Highly recommend!!!"
Taco Fish,"Not just the most delicious fish tacos but the best tacos of any kind I have had in Tucson (and in general fish tacos are not my favorite type of taco).  (For the sake of comparison, Taqueria Pico de Gallo's fish tacos are not even close).  I have had the fish, shrimp, and gordo tacos, and all are fantastic.  The seafod is tender and cooked perfectly, and the sauces are unbelievable.  The tacos are also big enough to easily make each one into two tacos (especially the gordo).  Make sure you also get some of their homemade limonada."
El Dorado Tortilla Factory Restaurant,"Regular for their Red Menudo,  I've had my menudo cravings almost everywhere in tucson from El Molinito to Little Mexico Restaurants.  This place by far beyond other menudos.  Homestyle fresh everytine menudo. Its a MUST for Menudo lovers like myself.  Service cam vary but the food makes up for it.  5 stars :)"
Mariscos Chihuahua,"I really love this place. I was almost scared to go because the area isn't the greatest but it really surprised me how good this food is. They claim their ceviche is their best but I actually recommend their shrimp dish, I don't remember the name but ask any server and they will recommend it to you. Its affordable and they let you pay with credit cards."
Percheron,They have my 3rd favorite food (bacon) wrapped around my 1st favorite food (burritos) I don't know what more you could want
Lerua's Fine Mexican Food,"My wife and I were in town for just a couple of days and hoping to find a good Mexican restaurant. And we found it! The food was incredibly delicious and the portions were huge. The wait staff were friendly and gave a great recommendation to try out the green corn tamales, I'm happy I took her advise. Whenever we are in Arizona we will make a point to stop in Tucson just for this place."
Taco Fish,"Great hole in the wall! Love the shrimp tacos, and the salsa bar where you can really build your tacos up! Each taco comes with about 4 shrimp and 2 tortillas, so you can make its 2 tacos in one! We also got a cup of their Bichi, which was free. Bichi is a shrimp soup, it was pretty much just broth, but was a yummy treat. I always get a Mexican coke as well, I just love it!"
Guadalajara Original Grill,Amazing Mexican food! Their Molcajetes were really incredible that featured a very tasty yet light broth with incredibly well cooked meats and veggies. Highly recommend checking them out. Also some of the best margaritas I've had anywhere! Well done!
Guadalajara Original Grill,"Wow! Pleasant surprise to get such authentic and delicious Mexican food. The salsa is made at the table, and molcajete was outstanding l!"
Tucson Tamale Company,My brother visiting Tucson so we wanted a non common chain. So glad we stopped in. The green chili pork was delicious.
Frank's,"How often have you driven by a restaurant for years - like decades - and say to yourself, ""We really need to go there.""?  That will a exactly what happened on a pleasant spring morning, and we finally went!
This restaurant is small and efficient and cute!  We opted to eat outside, pretty much thrilled to not have to wait for a seat on a Saturday morning.  We were greeted quickly with ice water (nice!), and our drink orders were taken.  The menus are part of the table covering - smart!  And the prices are low, low, low!  My husband and I opted for ""expensive"" dishes.  He chose the Eric burrito with chorizo - scrambled eggs with chorizo, chili sauce, cheese, and refried beans in a fresh tortilla.  It was a knife and fork burrito, and it was delicious!  I chose the chicken fried steak and eggs (soft scramble was perfectly prepared), hashbrowns, and white toast.  The toast has visible butter (maybe margarine, but I didn't care because it was good!).  The chicken fried steak was perfect, with real gravy - no packaged stuff here.  Heavenly!
The menu prices are low and kind of funny.  $2.20, $4.19, $10.40, etc.  Low!  There is a weekday special if you arrive before 9:00 am, and I think it was $2.25.  Eggs, a breakfast meat, potatoes, and a bread product (including fresh biscuits!).  Totally affordable.  
This is a no frills breakfast / lunch spot, and it is marvelous!!!!!
So, don't keep driving by places thinking that you should go there.  Stop, and enjoy those cute, local restaurants!!!!"
Tucson Tamale Company,"I LOVE TAMALE'S!!! When they are done right! And this place has it going ON!!!  They were quick and I didn't have to wait in a long line. And soooo Friendly too!

I had the beef chipotle tamale with mild sauce and a side salad all under 6 bucks!  GREAT place for lunch or a little afternoon snack."
Ramiro’s Mexican food,"Great food, fair price, quickly prepared, nice customer service. I had the chicken taco and chicken torta with fries. First time visit."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Tucson - Reid Park,"Great Hotel for the money ( paid 53 dollars hotwire) Good bed, sheets and towels, great location too."
Chickenuevo,"My two cents is Chickenuevo is great fast food! The chicken is super flavorful and the sides are completely respectable as well. Just as notable is the staff has always been super nice when I drive thru. I've only ever ordered straight up chicken with sides of refried beans and red rice, so I can't honestly comment on any other menu item. But so far so good, and we've been pretty regular customers for at least a few years. Oh! Their flour tortillas are terrific!"
Frank's,"Look. Even if the only table you can get is the one next to the bathroom, just take it. The food is so good you won't want to wait for another table. Frank's is the epitome of a classic cafe with great food. 
The food here is great and the service is on point. I recommend going for breakfast. 
You must understand, I workout. So whenever I go to Frank's I enter as a fairly fit young man, and I leave as a 7 month pregnant woman from all the great food. I shed a tear of happiness for my newly conceived food baby. I will raise my child with great pride. I always leave Frank's a better man. I recommend going to Frank's if you have a mouth and stomach. Bless up peeps."
The B-Line,Everything here is so good and the people are amazing. Great atmosphere and service plus they make an awesome Dirty Iced Chai.
Mariscos Chihuahua,Outstanding!!!! I have been trying to come here since I've been in Tucson for almost three years now and let me tell you I've been missing out. This place is great and good!!! Super fresh oysters. The salsa is spectacular. The service was awesome and I really enjoyed my meal. The camaron culichi was incredible. I will definitely rely be coming back here as soon as I can!!!
Toto's Tacos Restaurant,This is now my favorite taco place! I liked it so much that we went there for Mother's Day and loved it even more. I had their tacos de cabeza and carne asada tacos. Don't forget to add toritos to your order!
Mr Baja Fish,"Great service, great interior, appropriate music, delicious food!  Don't come here to stuff your face, rather enjoy the tastes this establishment has to offer.  Fried Fish Taco is better than the Shrimp imo; get them fried!  The big boy cocktail (name eludes me) has imitation seafood so beware and read the labels; they are very transparent.  There's a military discount, obviously since it's located right outside of the base.  Give it a go!"
Sunny Daze Cafe,Love this place!!!!! The food is awesome every time we come here. The value of the food is great for the price. The staff is priceless!  Always friendly the minute you walk in and always making sure the coffee is hot. The Puffs are so good you'll manage to eat them even on a full stomach !
Calle Tepa,"I only spent a few days in Tucson on business, and I'm so glad I found this gem.  I can see why it averages 4.5 stars after over 300 reviews.
Let's start with the ambiance.  When you walk in it appears to be a fast casual restaurant where you order at a register.  I chose to sit at the bar where the bartender welcomed me and told me they can take care of my food ordering.  I started with the chips and green salsa which has a great flavor with just the right amount of heat.  
The food was outstanding.  I received a recommendation from a regular at the bar and ordered the carne asada tepas taco and the white cheese quesadilla.  The tepas taco was a grilled buttered tortilla , and topped with fresh pico, cheese and lettuce.  The meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection!  I could have eaten 3 more!  The quesadillas were gooey and crispy!  A must visit near the park place mall!"
El Guero Canelo,"Awsome!!! Food and I go there maybe 1-3 a month when I can. I feel like going now seeing the pictures and name. You won't regret stopping by this place. People are friendly and food comes out pretty quick. 

I would recommend this place"
Calle Tepa,"I thought this place was fantastic for gringo Mexican food. 

In Tuscon, you never know what you might get, especially if you don't speak Spanish well and this place was a great restaurant for us gringos.  

Straight forward menu of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc very easy to understand.  Order up front and they bring the food right to you.

I had an excellent Michelada from the bar and the wife enjoyed her margarita.

We shared the four variety of veggie tacos and they were all great.

Excellent chips with a great variety of fresh salsas at the bar, mango jalepeno being the crowd favorite.

Fast, fresh and easy.  Definitely recommend."
El Guero Canelo,"My co-workers took me here 6 years ago and I've been a fan ever since. I was pregnant then I just couldn't resist the Sonoran hot dogs. My new love is their carne asada torta, but I've liked every thing I've ever tried here: the carne asada tacos, burritos, menudo. The bread for the hot dogs, tortas & menudo is divine. And the different salsas are wonderful. My favorite is the green avocado based one. The place is always clean and the staff has always been very friendly. My kids love this place!"
Sunny Daze Cafe,Well it looked like a colorful place on the outside and it was just as colorful on the inside excellent service excellent food going back again tomorrow morning can't wait thank you
El Guero Canelo,the vegetarian option was the bean and cheese burrito. but that along with the salsa bar were awesome!
Miguel's,"I stayed in Hampton Inn, which is right next to this restaurant. I love to eat and do not endorse anything that I don't like. I liked the food and the ambiance of the restaurant. Nice place to eat and relax after a hectic day. The food was nicely served with excellent service."
Sunny Daze Cafe,Great food and service. I was introduced to Sunny Daze back in 2007 and been a loyal customer since. Keep up the great work and delicious food!!
El Guero Canelo,"By far my favorite Mexican food in Tucson. I've lived here 17 yrs and have enjoyed my food every single time. I highly recommend the Sonoran dogs with everything and the mango smoothie with chili powder. I also like their torta. I get the Pollo. My husband always gets Carne.
It's not much to look at and the neighborhood might put some off, but it's authentic Tucson. If you're not too stuck up,  you'll be happy you came to 12th Avenue for Canelos!"
El Guero Canelo,"This place is amazing.  I have lived in AZ my whole life and just discovered the Sonoran Hot Dog.  I don't even like hot dogs normally but this one is so stinking good!!!  I will come back when I'm down in Tucson again.  We also had their street tacos that were really good as well.

Food came out really promptly and the place was packed for lunch.

Friendly staff as well, extra bonus.  Can't wait to come back."
Taqueria El Pueblito,"Wanted a breakfast burrito around noon. They serve breakfast all day. I decided to try it. I have never been here before so I blindly trusted Yelp. 

I got a Zacatecas burrito with egg. It was gigantic. It was the only thing I needed to eat all day. It was affordable and it was delicious!

The restaurant was clean, moderately busy, and the staff were very polite. 

I will absolutely eat here again! Next time I will try the chilaquiles."
Taqueria El Pueblito,"I love the spice baby.  Muy bueno!  
I'll drive here from now on for a breakfast burrito.  No where have i found a breakfast burro so good they are deelish...
Barbacoa burro...mmmmmmmmmmmm
Thanks so much for making good food!"
El Guero Canelo,Stopped in on recommendation from a friend who used to live in the area. Didn't realize this place was famous before going. I got the large carne asada burrito and a medium horchata. The horchata came with one free refill. The burrito was almost purely filled with meat. The meat was extremely flavorful. The burrito was huge. I actually couldn't finish it. I was full for the rest of the day. You get a tremendous meal for a very reasonable price. My co-workers had the Sonoran Hotdog. They said it was good as well. Recommend following the locals advice and stop in here when you are in town.
Nico's Mexican Food,"Yum!! Whenever I eat here I'm not disappointed. I've had an array of their food, but I'm mostly about the nachos. The salsa is very good too :)"
El Guero Canelo,"Another Tucson favorite for me. Do not think twice about trying this place out. One of the most authentic tastes of Tucson.

I'm going to start with my favorite. The carne asada burrito, just plain perfect. I get carne, cheese, cabbage, and I love it. I've had it too many times to remember. Wednesday nights you get a medium burrito, with a coke for $5. Definitely an awesome deal. I'd always see friends there as well on Wednesday nights. Plenty of space to have a little hang out/meet-up. The carne asada burrito is a little bit on the greasy side, you won't notice until you are at the last few bites of the burrito and the grease is dripping down your hands. Its not a big issue though when you just finished a heaping pound of cow.

The perfect complement to all the food is the awesome buffet style salsa bar. I mean, you could sort of have a buffet with this bar. They have grilled jalapenos (two kinds) and grilled green onions available. This is seriously amazing, and a perfect complement for your burrito. I always get some pico in a plate along with some lime and the green (gauc) sauce for my burrito and put a bit of each on every single bite with a fork. 

Chicken caramelo's are awesome too. I usually share half a medium carne asada burrito and half a chicken caramelo with my GF. Soda selection is limited, but its awesome, feels interesting drinking from a glass bottle. Very unique experience.

I've met the owner once or twice, and I feel that he genuinely cares about his customers. This place was featured on Man vs. Food (for the sonoran dogs), and maybe rightly so. Although, to be honest, I've never tried the sonoran dogs (kosher thing). The largely, latino staff is very friendly, don't be shy.

When I think of Tucson, this is one of the few places that I think of. Always a good experience. The pricing and quality of the food makes this place amazing."
El Gorrion,"This is the most legit Sonora Mexican place I've found.  There are more expensive places further south into the heart of South Tucson, but only El Gorrion is allowed to roll their roach coach into the gigantic Raytheon plant (where I first had their burritos, 10 years ago).  After moving back to Tucson from Canada, I was pleasantly surprised to still find them on 12th & Ajo (easy to get to via the I-19 interchange).  The food is consistent, staff is friendly, and I crave it weekly."
El Guero Canelo,"I go visit family once a year in Tucson, and that Guero Canelo can sure make good food.  Arriba Mexico!! Arriba Tucson.  Guero Canelo is the best when it comes to Mexican food in Tucson.  The place is so neat, there's like a huge outdoor eating area, and you are sitting next to all kinds of people, everyone having a great time.  Reminds me of a Mexican house party, everyone just enjoying good food and great ambiance.  If I remember correctly they have banda playing in the background.  I loved it!! Tucson needed somewhere as good as Guero Canelo."
La Olla Mexican Cafe,"Monday through Saturday there is a great menu for 5.75 for lunch! Lots of good food for that great price! Everything else is also reasonably priced. It is on my side of town and a quiet, casual gem that not enough people know about. I think that is a good thing! I don't think I even need to give recs...all their plates I have tried are fantastic. I don't think you can go wrong! My fave part about this place?!? The drinks aren't weak! Love it! Not the spiciest Mexican food around, but great taste and great service! Give this place a try when you are up on this side of town for sure!"
Carniceria los Vaqueros,"I ordered 5 dozen tamales for a Christmas party. Amazing!! Lots of meat, great flavor and decent price! $16 a dozen, bought red chili beef and green corn. Will buy again for sure"
Taqueria El Pueblito,"This is the best food I have ever ate. By far the best Mexican food I have tried in any state... even Mexico can't touch this one!! The best flavor of any Mexican restaurant ever. The barbacoa tacos are amazing as well as the carnitas torta, breakfast burritos are awesome and you definitely get what you pay for great portion sizes great service perfect environment but most of all the flavors here are priceless!! Thanks Guys!!"
El Guero Canelo,"They know what they do and do it well. Cheap but quality food. Don't even think about the atmosphere, just a massive taco truck experience but scaled to meet the demand. Great salsa bar! Guacamole was fresh and tasty. Horchata was average. The hot dog with all the teachers fixings was shockingly fun and tasty. I'm not sure I would make it a regular order but it was worth tasting at least once. 

Would be happy to return!"
Miguel's,Love this place. Stopped here on way to Calif and again on way home to Tx.   Had chili rellano both times. Loved the black beans and their oaxacan rice.   Very pleasant decor and friendly waitstaff
El Guero Canelo,Stopped here after landing because I miss good Mexican food because I am a displaced San Diegan living in Miami.  This is an excellent small shop with what you expect in California at a shop. Salsa bar with plenty of add ons for your burrito. I got a medium and it was great for lunch but if you are looking for that put you to sleep burrito upgrade to the large. Good selection of sodas.
Nico's Taco Shop,"Happy I found Nico's! Tacos are the bomb.com. 

I had the carnitas, shredded beef, and fish tacos. Carnitas were my favorite, beef are served on a homemade hard taco (delicious), and the fish is battered and fried. 

I am assuming the salsas - green and red - are homemade as well... Both are good and not too spicy. 

Thanks for treating me to good tacos out west!"
Carniceria los Vaqueros,"Love the food here. Only complaint is every time i order a breakfast burrito they overcharge me. 
But...it's really really good! 
Yelp on!"
Taqueria El Pueblito,"I've been looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Tucson and I think this is it. It's similar to Filibertos, but I like that. My dad really enjoyed this place also. He got the El Pastor burrito and he wants to go back all the time. He really enjoyed the salsa bar. I got a Carnitas burrito and the meat was flavorful and it was pretty large portion size. I had enough to take home. The atmosphere was nice and not too loud. The employees were helpful and very nice!"
La Olla Mexican Cafe,Best food option in NW Tucson.  Unique combinations in addition to the standard Mexican fare and all packed with flavor.    I'd bet if this place were more centrally located it would be doing gangbusters.
Carniceria los Vaqueros,Fantastic food.  Their Chili Rellenos  are incredible!!!!  The new booths and tables look Great.  This place is much better with the new owners.  It went from a a 5 to a 10.  We order food for 70 people at Chapman Honda a couple times per month.  They do a fantastic job. Thanks guys
Nico's Mexican Food,"I recently tried this location a couple times and I haven't been disappointed with anything. They give you big portions & the food is good! I tried the carne asada plate & there was SO MUCH in there, it was definitely worth the price. I would recommend this location for sure!"
Sunny Daze Cafe,We are having dinner and the hubby got all you can eat Cat fish Nuggets for 9.99 and I'm eating all you can eat fried fish  the coleslaw is so yummy and great green beans      We are going to share a mango raspado    Great service Cynthia and  Flor. Love the sunny puffs
Sunny Daze Cafe,Great breakfast spot. Country fried steak was delicious and flipping huge! The hot cakes were massive too! Definitely recommend.
Guadalajara Mexican Grill,"Guadalajara Grill is one of my favorite restaurants in Tucson and every time I visit I have wonderful service. From mariachi bands to fresh salsa to personable servers that are fast and responsive. Today we visited and had the pleasure of having Daniel as our server, which did not disappoint. He was very respectful, helpful, and quick to satisfy any of our needs (especially for a party of 8). He was phenomenal and I highly recommend him anytime you visit. Request Daniel for a great experience at the one and only Guads!"
Calle Tepa,I've eaten here many times already with no problems every time. Keep up the good work.
La Olla Mexican Cafe,"WOW! ...WHERE HAVE I BEEN????

 This restaurant has been here since 2007 and we passed by it soooooo many times. Thanks to all the fellow yelpers we decided to give it a try...and boy were glad we did.

Im gonna go on a limb and say its the best mexican food IN TUCSON!
the food is authentic, the kind you find off the beaten path in mexico...as much as we teavel and eat in Mexico, we should know. And have i mentioned im self proclaimed mexican!

Trista, our server, recomended the combo #5 or carnitas. My undecisive Hubby couldnt make up his mind so i suggested he orders  the #5 and i take the pork carnitas and my dad had the ground beef tostada.
Boy, was Trista RIGHT...#5 had a soft taco  carne asada, carnitas enchilada and manchego shrimp wrapped in bacon served with rice and beans That plate did not have a chance with my now 225lb meat loving Hubs. He also said and i quote, ""that was a good call Hun, best mexican food Ive had in the U.S. This is where were going to take our visiting friends.""

Mybplatter consisted of well seasoned moost carnitas, drizzled with (i think) sour cream or mexican crema, sweet corn and green chili tamale pie and calabcita which was off the hook!
I tried to take the tamale pie home to eat as a dessert later but who was i lying to...didnt survive by the human vaccum...major fail on my part trying to portion control. 

This is my new go to Mexican food...delish"
Carniceria los Vaqueros,"Consistently Fantastic! 
Everything from the selection of spices, homemade tortillas and fresh hot red & green tamales is delicious. 
Every burrito is bomb too! 
The prices are great, I can't ever finish anything in just one meal.  
A friend recommended this place ~ I'm so glad we tried it.  
By far our favorite carneceria in Tucson."
Sonoran Brunch Company,Everything we had was 10/10 for our first time trying Sonoran Brunch Company. All perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful. The wings wings and waffle were excellent. I loved the corn meal waffle and it was just the right amount of sweetness paired with the wings. The chorizo puffs are something I know I'll probably order every time. I loved the aioli it was paired with. I saw others suggested the Cubano and now that I've had it I can see why. The meat is cooked perfectly and is juicy. The bread was also great. Can't wait to try more on their menu.
Sonoran Brunch Company,"First time stopping in here tonight and we were not disappointed! Great food and customer service. The family meal deal is so amazing and we were stuffed! If you're looking for a great Mexican restaurant on the east side, try this place out."
Calle Tepa,"Wow!  What a great place!  I went for lunch, and got two street tacos (carne asada and carnitas, for $3.49 each), and a Sonoran Hot Dog ($4.49).  Everything was delicious.  I especially like their fresh tortillas - they're a bit thicker and chewier than traditional tortillas.  The salsa bar is large and complimentary, and the cantina in the back feels just like Mexico.  I'll be back!"
Juice N Fruit Raspados,"Went here on a whim on my way to Flagstaff and it was so delicious. Service was so helpful and welcoming, and the food was incredible."
Teresa's Mosaic Cafe,"Was in town for business and a colleague brought me here for lunch. If you're in Tucson and want good food COME HERE!! Machaca melts in your mouth. Homemade tortillas are awesome. Tamales have amazing flavor and masa isn't mushy. Was introduced to a great accompaniment called calabacitas. I've had Mexican food all over the West & Southwest but this was my first time trying this dish. They're awesome. Next time I'm in town I'm coming back for breakfast based on the reviews and comments from locals. 

Service was great. Very attentive and server knew the menu inside and out. Very impressed."
Tucson Tamale,"My friends met me here we were all new customers. What a tasty adventure. We had so much fun we stayed almost 3 hours. There is a Groupon out to bring new customers  in. I had Paela tamales, black beans that rock,great salsa  variety  it couldn't have been better.We all agreed this was going to be our meet and greet place. Had a little vino and enjoyed the warm staff. They were happy to hear us rave about the food. They didn't give us the your finished now,  give us our table back. It's self service all the salsa you want, chips are extra, very fresh and good. I plan on being a regular at this location  on Oracle.  My friends are vegans and there were so many options to choose from. On Groupon is ""The Tamale Factory ""$11. For 22.00 dinner for 2. same center as Macayos mex food, but way tastier less costly."
El Guero Canelo,"Flew in from San Francisco and this was our first stop    It was great.  Ordering is easy

Sonoran hot dog (first time and we loved it, especially the bun)
and
Beef taco

The salsa bar was incredible with grilled green onions and jalapeño peppers. There were cucumbers and radishes and pickled onions.  It's practically a full meal in itself

We then went up to Sabino Canyon and took the tram ride. Gorgeous!!!  It was 90 degrees so we are going back tomorrow to hike earlier in day"
El Guero Canelo,"Best sonoran hot dog! Every time I visit Tucson, I MUST GO HERE!"
Teresa's Mosaic Cafe,"Ok peeps, I thought SEIS Restaurant was delicious but this place just beat it!!! I had the Sunday Special which was extremely delicious with a side of chile Serrano toreados 
You will LOVE it...
Oh yeah, not to mention, Bobby Flay Showdown...hands down."
Tucson Tamale,"Second stop of our visit. 
Lots of options. 
Vegan, vegetarian, meat, sweat, and all GLUTEN FREE! (I know, duh! It's corn, but some people mix)
Served as plates, with two sides. 
Other options are burritos and salads. 
Price was okay for all of us (no added drinks)"
Papa Locos,"This place is always outstanding. The chili relleño burger and fries always hits the spot & their signature ""Encha-Loco"" is fabulous. They also have one of those soda machines that has a touch screen and you can get any concoction your heart desires. Also, get the churro. TRUST me"
Restaurant Sinaloa,Really cool atmosphere and the food is amazing. Recommended dishes are the Molcajetero Barba Roja and any of the fish filet dishes. Good appetizers are the Chicharrón de Pargo and the Shrimp Toritos. Warning serving sizes are huge!
El Molinito,Very friendly staff and excellent food. I have always loved this place and am so happy it's near my job. They also have a drive-thru making it even more convenient to get this amazing food!
Teresa's Mosaic Cafe,My family has been eating at Teresa's Mosaic since it was a shack at Speedway & Silverbell with no where to sit & you stood in line for 20 minutes to get burritos.  It is always a joy to see Alphonso Senior's smiling face or have Son David stop by the table to visit.  My favorite is the Mole Chicken with Calabesitas .  They make a pretty darn good Margarita as well.  love this place.
Teresa's Mosaic Cafe,"Super fresh, all the ingredients and sauces are made in the restaurant. They have the best huevos rancheros in the nation."
El Berraco,"Really cool place to try Latin food, mainly Colombian style, with very unique, creative, and sumptuous flavors from regions of Latin America.  The coconut flan is INCREDIBLE and the pina colada is delicious!  The supervisor Elizabeth was sweet, delightful and accommodating, and our server Ivette was very attentive."
Tequila's Mexican & Seafood,"I had noticed that the parking lot was always packed so I finally dropped in this afternoon for lunch by myself.  Wow Wow Wow!!!  Loved it.  The servers were all so great and made sure I was happy.  Just ordered the #25, three tacos, and got wonderfully tender beef in soft corn tortillas just like I got off the Mexican food trucks.  The menu is soooo big and full of things I can't wait to try next.  I'll be back and will bring wifey the next time."
Tequila's Mexican & Seafood,"眞物美價廉！Came from Phoenix to see the Mission San Xavier del Bac which is about 8+ miles away from this restaurant and was definitely worth driving over. 

I am Mexican and do not like to visit Mexican restaurants as I feel they are never authentic enough. However, this place made me feel like I was eating at home. 

Not only was the food awesome, but the staff was quite welcoming and attentive to all our needs.

Next time, my family and I are in Tucson, we will come again. Thanks for the delicious and very reasonably priced dinner! (:"
Teresa's Mosaic Cafe,Fantastic experience! The complementary chips and salsa were delicious. I loved my chicken mole enchiladas. The atmosphere is very nice and the staff were friendly and attentive. Nothing bad to say! This place is great.
Tucson Tamale,"Tucson Tamale catered my wedding rehearsal dinner for over 100 people and did a wonderful job. The food was delicious and everything came just as we asked for it. Many complements were shared among our guest. Frank and Chloe made the process of ordering, delivery and setting up extremely easy and stress free. All exceeded my expectations. My only feedback was that we had significantly more food than we needed for the amount of people we paid for so had to donate some."
El Guero Canelo,"My first time in Tucson and my friends from all over told me how good this place is so naturally I had to try it. I LOVE this place. Unpretentious, not fancy at all and DELICIOUS. The salsa bar was banging and everything I had was amazing and fresh. I will be be back for sure next time I'm in AZ. Don't go anywhere! :)"
El Berraco,"No debate, this is the best Mexican sea food restaurant in town. Actually, it goes beyond Mexican. Think Pacific Rim Mexico and south, and it may be the best place for fish, shrimp, oysters..., in Tucson . 
We had some oyster and shrimp shooters and several entrees. Everything was really on target, and spicy means spicy which is a welcome change . 
There was a soccer game on all the TVs (TRI against Chile) so it was loud, but fun. 
Going to be there at least monthly as the menu seems to have many choices we want to try."
Los Betos Mexican Food,Seriously- the best nachos I've ever had in my life. I decided to try them on a whim and bring them home  to enjoy while watching a movie on Netflix. I tend to grab my phone to give a bad review far faster than a good review but I had to put my movie on hold to tell everyone to try the nachos supreme. I'm dying. They're amazing!!!
El Guero Canelo,Best smoked chicken in Tucson!  The atmosphere is similar to a bus station with all stainless steel tables and the loud speaker blaring random order numbers for pickup but it's all part of the charm!
Sammy's Mexican Grill,"I absolutely love the food at Sammies. The chef, Jorge is excellent, and always in a good mood... Making sure you get the good vibes in the food. I used to go to other Mexican restaurants in the area, but you cannot beat SAMMYS for great food, great prices, Great menu choices,...And... They deliver! Love it!"
Street- Taco and Beer Co.,"So glad this finally opened! A great surprise after a long wait. We have eaten here twice this week and both times were excellent. The guys are so nice. Talkative, fast, and enthusiastic. The food is sooooo good. We ordered fried fish tacos, carne asada, carnitas, burros. For the tacos, you can get them street or gringo. We went with street. Everything is fresh and loaded. Mexican sodas and fresh brewed tea too!"
Casa Valencia,The   food is the  bomb!!! Excellent choices. Most of  the  time  service  is  good. Sometimes the  service is  lacking especially on  getting  drink  refills. But I'll keep  going  back  for  the  food
Mi Tierra Restaurant,The most authentic mexican food I've ever had. This place is a hidden gem
El Taco Tote,This is the best taco in Tucson. We have been coming here for over  five years and NEVER had a bad meal. Try either the Barbacoca or Sirloin. Price is right and the salsa bar is outstanding. Go there if you want the  best.
The Blacktop Grill,Amazing Sonoran hot dog!!  Great fresh topping and a humongous beef dog!!  Yummy sirachi coleslaw too!  We will be back to try more things!  Great find!!  You won't be disappointed!
The Blacktop Grill,This is my new favorite spot!  Best thing is its right down the street on Thornydale road. It has many   vegetarian options. I order the green chili cheese shell tacos and there was so many layers of favor. I can't wait to try another dish. The employees where very nice. I hope they offer veggie  sonoran dogs soon.
El Molinito,"Wow, we had the mixed combo for two, Wow
This is now one of our favorite places for good food! Order a burrito and ask the waitress to bring the take home box with the order. Our item lasted for two and a half meals. The service was.excellent."
El Berraco,"On vacation in Tucson and we just happened upon this quirky, looks like a submarine restaurant! The host, and servers were very friendly and the food spectacular and unusual! The chips and white bean guerita were terrific and the la Tropical salad with coconut shrimp, dried cranberries, mango was very tasty! Lots of attention to details made it a very pleasant experience!"
El Berraco,"This place is absolutely amazing and so clean !! The staff is so nice, friendly, very professional. Music is great!. 
Alone the environment is so beautiful, a little submarine, with the inside theme that goes perfect. 
Food, is out of this world. And the drinks are indescribable. One of my last stops before a long navy deployment. I appreciate y'all !!"
Perfecto's Mexican,"I came in for a breakfast of Red  Menudo
About ten days ago and had a side tamale with mole'   
It was so good , I crossed town tonight so I could make Tamales and Eggs for dinner. 

A dozen tamales , 20.00. Fair. None frozen. 
And a sign says, CASH only for tamales only.  Good thing I had cash. 

Made a great dinner, worth the effort."
Taqueria Porfis,"Have you ever wanted a punch of flavor in a taco that melts into your mouth? That's what you can expect from a taco al vapor from this place. On this occasion, I got the combination (chimi, taco al vapor and taco dorado) and even though everything was good, the taco dorado was not a showstopper. We also got a quesadilla, and it was ok. The flour tortilla on the quesadilla was good. This place is very, very understated. The menu is very short, and they really do few things, but do them well. Get the tacos al vapor. They'll for sure make you want to come back."
Nico's,Best Mexican take out in Tucson imo but everybody here has their own favorite because there's so many options. The Super nachos are dank af and the red chicken tacos are surprisingly bomb too. The one thing that makes me mad though is that they sell a shrimp burrito but will refuse to make shrimp tacos or shrimp quesadillas upon request. Not a huge deal but annoying haha.
El Guero Canelo,"I lived in Tucson for many years but, until this last trip home, had never tasted a Sonoran hot dog. Since I waited until becoming an old lady to eat one of those Tucson specialities, I figured I better go to one of the places that serve up the best...so El Guero Canelo's it was. 

You walk into what looks like a huge warehouse with tons of tables. It's not exactly swank and not all cushiony and comfortable but the tables work fine for sitting to eat some hot dogs. 

The folks behind the counter are friendly. They were also patient as I debated what and how to order. I know they have lots of good Mexican dishes on their menu but I was there for those hot dogs. 

The Sonoran hot dog bun is very soft and almost sweetish against the spicy tang of the condiments that make a Sonoran dog Sonoran. It all works. If what they put on your dog doesn't suffice there is a whole buffet line of salsa type extras you can slather up for either a side type dish or a topping for the dog. 

I'm always looking for good Mexican food and will return her to try some of their other plates."
Sammy's Mexican Grill,"Have passed this place for ages, but never eaten there until today. Because of the coronavirus concerns, used the drive thru. Don't think the inside was open anyway. Highly impressed with the food (carne asada tacos and the massive Sammy's burrito), delicious and fresh. I looked at some of the reviews; either very high or very low, which I don't understand. Suspect some of the negativity is due to the owner's political leanings and believe some people are leaving very negative reviews just to be a**holes. We will begin eating here frequently. Recommend you give this locally owned place a chance."
Poncho's Restaurant,"Really good burritos, especially the chile relleno and machaca.  they just raised their prices, no longer a GREAT deal... but still OK... and still big size burros and nice people."
El Guero Canelo,"We haven't been here for years.  Not because it isn't good but we like exploring all the new restaurants  sprouting up.   The caramelos are still awesome.  Carne asada with cheese folded over a grilled tortilla.  I like the beans on the side.  Being that they are in the race for the best burrito we had to see what all the hoopla is about.  Yes, it is really up to snuff.  The medium size is gigantic and could not be finished in one sitting.  Also love the salsa bar which beats any I've been to.  Usually they have roasted green onions but for some reason they weren't there.  Just a sign over the container apologizing for that.  Those peppers were available and they were marked HOT.  I love the barrack style atmosphere here.  It's really ""down home"" and for the people.  Lots of large families gather here and groups of friends.  A great people watching place. Didn't get the Sonoran Hot Dog this time but theirs is truly the best in town.  More good news for those people who live in Phoenix.  They are going to be opening another restaurant  there soon so be on the look out.  You all are in for a big treat.  Also I noticed they added a salad in a taco bowl.  I'm usually eating pretty healthy but when coming here I forget all that and go for the real deal."
El Manantial Tacos Y Hotdogs,I've been coming here for about 3 years now and they have the best Sonoran dog in town. I haven't found a better one. I always get their burrito with the green salsa and it's the best. It would definetly recommend this place. They should open a restaurant. I'd go
Aqui Con el Nene,Had the carne asada taco and marinated pork crispy taco! Very good flavor in the meats and my food was served so fast. Would recommend to anyone in the area!
Saguaro Corners Restaurant & Bar,Everyone has a bad night I have been here at least ten times and only once was the service poor.  The menu is what it is it is not the place if you're looking for allot of choices  but if you stick to the Mexican food you won't be disappointed.  This is the kind of place that they will remember you and  you feel right at home even if dinning alone. The staff works hard to do whatever they can to make you experience a good one. The nights they have live music are great. Also if you're looking for a place that can set large groups they will accommodate.  This a no thrills set down have a few tacos a drink without feeling your bothering anyone when you sit and talk after dinner. If you're looking for fancy this is not the place.
Saguaro Corners Restaurant & Bar,"This place is awesome! A friend of mine lives out in the area and we wanted to try something new. When we got there we chose to sit outside as the weather was nice and it was tented. The waitress was very knowledgeable, friendly and prompt. She said they had just changed their menu and suggested her new favorites. I chose the tamale pie. Ho. Lee. Moly. I almost ordered another plate but could hardly move after the side of chorizo Mac n Cheese. Surprisingly it wasn't greasy and so delicious. I had heard that their pumpkin empanadas were really great too however they took those off at the menu change. I did try the apple ones and those were perfect! My friend ordered the dip platter as an appetizer and that could've and should have served more than just us two. The queso fundito is beyond words. I could eat that all day, everyday. I regret not trying one of their interesting signature cocktails however that just gives me an excuse to go back; which I will definitely be doing."
Sonoras Famous Hot Dogs & Grill,New place to try. Great service. The Sonoran hot dogs are delicious and not overpriced at all!  Really impressed with the menu and great place for a casual date or with family.
Los Betos Mexican Food,"Another Tucson fast food Mexican Chain classic!  In my opinion, not quite as good as Nico's but still great!  I highly recommend their Carne Assada Burrito!

Located at the corner of Grant and First, this Betos location has both a drive through in addition to outside picnic tables.  The outside picnic tables are great at night and in the winter.  However, during the summer you will cook faster then your food if you eat outside!  Most people who come here do get their food to go.  Prices are inexpensive as 2 people should easily be able to spend under $12 total."
Molina's Midway Mexican Foods,"My parents and grandma moved from the east coast over 55 years ago. They had never eaten Mexican food before their move to Tucson. Initially their first encounter with Molina's was odd and nothing special. STOP right there. You have to remember they came from the ""east coast"" where (55 plus years ago) they didn't have Mexican food restaurants. 
Over time the food grew on my folks and grandma. We as kids only knew Midway Molina's Mexican food. As we got older nothing compared to this particular Molina's authentic Mexican food. We always sat in Mary's station back in the day and then I can say approximately the past 34 years we were regulars to Suzanna or as we know her as Suzy. Over time we got to know her sons Fernando and Mico. 
Everyone at Midway Molina's treated us like family. It could be because it is family owned and their employees have other family members working there too. Most of their work staff have been loyal employees. 
Now about their food... I haven't had any bad food or service since I have been coming to this restaurant. My personal favorite is the Sonora style Chili Cheese Crisps. The Margaritas sneak up on you because they are so delicious and you can't put one down. 
Well with all this said after 64 years they just announced they are closing their doors. My family will miss everyone and the delicious meals. You have one week before they close so I recommend you go ASAP! They will be open this coming Tuesday (they were normally closed Monday and Tuesday). Expect a wait because so many people are like me and favor this particular Molina's. Please trust me it is worth the wait!"
Mi Nidito Restaurant,"I'm born and raised in Tucson and this has always been my favorite Mexican restaurant. The margaritas are really good too. Excellent Mexican food, but be ready to wait."
La Botana Tacos,This is a must stop whenever I come and visit Tucson. Nothing on the menu has ever disappointed me and my family. Everything on my plate is always fresh tasting (which is very important to me). The staff here is very friendly and courteous. Can't wait to come back and visit.
Saguaro Corners Restaurant & Bar,"This place is consistently good. We have sampled many different items and have enjoyed most. The beer selection is great and we have always enjoyed that it is kid friendly. The staff is kind and competent. We are becoming regulars, which says a lot since we enjoy cooking at home! An east side treasure! (If I could recommend one thing though... the cheese sauce is not very saucy - needs to be less dense then all is perfect!!) :)"
Baja Cafe on Campbell,"Amazing breakfast and great service! We had the Wyatt Earp Eggs Benedict and it was just so delicious. For desert, cinnamon French toast that tasted just like a Cinnabon! Greats kids menu too:)"
Little Mexico,"I had the chorizo and eggs and my wife had the shredded beef tacos, both choices were awesome. The salsa was very good. Reminded me of home. Definitely recommended."
Old Pueblo Grille,"A long tiring trip from the UK finished with the perfect meal, great garden setting, excellent service and best marguerita drinks. Thanks OPG."
Mi Nidito Restaurant,"I absolutely love this place.. the food is amazing and the service is great... but you gotta get there early, there's usually a wait because the food is soooooo good and the staff is amazingly friendly... a must for me and my family every time we come to Tucson."
Filiberto's Mexican Food,Ordered the pollo asado burrito. Fantastic! Chicken was moist and flavorful. Decent size and I chomped it down. Service was friendly and prompt. Eating area was clean. I'll return again!
Street Taco And Beer,"This place has quality food for a pretty affordable price. Although they're not necessarily authentic, their food is amazing. I would definitely recommend getting the street dog!"
Baja Cafe on Campbell,"I never been out for brunch before but starting now I will! This place was amazing and customer service was excellent! I got a Benedict (Wyatt Earp) for the first time and it was fully loaded with just about everything you can think of. I couldn't even eat the whole thing because it was so big and I love to eat lol. Blake gave my friend and I a free snickerdoodle because it was our first time coming in and that was good. I was kind of hesitant about trying new things but glad I tried here. If you are ever in Tucson, please go there."
Viva Burrito,"Our favorite breakfast burrito place.  Jose will make them just how you like them.  I like a lot of lettuce and pico de Gallo, and they provide it.  Salsa is unpredictable (sometimes too watery) but recently they've stepped up their game and it is wonderful.  This is our taste of Tucson and they are so nice and friendly."
Tacos Apson,"The best tacos in Tucson. I am sosososo picky when it comes to Mexican tacos and am kinda judgy, but this is my favorite! I love coming here with mis compadres y familia, and just kick back with soda and some great tacos de asada."
Baja Cafe on Campbell,"So delicious!  The Black Widow and The Leprechaun were delicious!  Our kids enjoyed the Buttermilk Pancake, Kids French Toast, and Kids Egg Breakfast.   All walked away happy and full!  Will definitely be back!"
Baja Cafe on Campbell,"Best breakfast place in Tucson. We come here about every other weekend and have not once ever been disappointed. They have great pancakes, bacon, and hash browns. The host, servers, bartenders, and manager(s) are very friendly and super helpful when you need/want something. 10/10 great environment and service."
Mr Antojo,"Here is a heretical statement: this place has my favorite Sonoran hot dogs in Tucson.  Yes, I said it.  A gas station-based Mexican food restaurant makes the best Sonoran hot dogs in Tucson.  I've been to BK and Guero Canelo, and I'll happily admit that those places do a good job.  I've also been to Hot Dogs Obregon, Karamelo King, Sammy el Sinoloanese, etc.  The ones here are just better.  The toppings are more balanced and flavorful, and the buns are to die for.  At $3 a pop, they're not cheap, but they're worth it.  Try one -- at the very least, you won't hate it.

But I have bigger goals for this review.  So listen:

If you are a fan of Mexican food -- and I mean a real fan -- then you are a fan of cabeza tacos.  In fact, you are probably irritated by how nonchalantly I bring them up.  Take it easy, though: I'm just saving my emotions.

Yes, cabeza tacos are amazing.  For those who haven't yet had them, the best way to describe them would be to say that they're like shredded beef tacos except about a gazillion times better.  And shredded beef tacos are pretty good to begin with.  

I've had cabeza tacos at a few places in Tucson, and I've had mixed experiences.  Not here, though.  These things are beautiful.  And at $2 each, they're one of the least expensive ways around to taste truly glorious food.  I have slowly been converting my friends to the cult of Mr. Antojo cabeza tacos, and now I want to spread the word to the greater community.  

Try these tacos.  You will thank me.  They usually have them from Wednesday to Friday; they almost never have them in time for lunch on Monday, and they only sometimes have them on Tuesday.  (And yes, cabeza means head; and no, there's no way at all to tell that you're eating that part of the animal.)

I should also mention that the couple who runs this place are among the friendliest people around.  You'll almost forget that you're waiting in a gas station!"
CharroVida,Charro Vida is a fabulous place to accommodate multiple tastes.  Chris is an excellent server who is knowledgeable about the menu. Awesome place and awesome food. HAPPY HOUR is for real. We will be back.
Baja Cafe on Campbell,My favorite breakfast place in town! You HAVE to try the pineapple Express pancakes!!
La Fresita Tucson,"found this place on yelp and was not disappointed - the chicken burrito was HUGE and CHEAP, and very good - $6 burrito was big enough to be dinner and lunch tomorrow, if I lived in Tucson I'd eat here daily"
El Pollo Loco,"If you haven't ever tried El Pollo Loco- it is by far the best fast food in Tucson. 

Their chicken is so consistently prepared and flavorful. 

Their chips ARE BETTER THAN CHIPOTLE. Yeah, I said it! 

Their home made cilantro cream sauce compliments the occasional jalapeño spice in some of their salsas.  Now that flavor has inspired me to have it be a staple is my own prep of Mexican dishes at home. 

You can't go wrong with anything on their menu.


The location is kind of tricky and they don't use their letter placement space under their sign always and it can come off as closed or out of business when driving by. All the better for me when there is no line ;).


The staff are wonderful but a special shout out to Amanda the drive though lady who is very wonderful. 


Thanks El Pollo Loco!

P.s. bring back the corn cake side dish please"
Breakfast Stop,"I love Breakfast Stop. They have all the usual breakfast items. What tickles my fancy though is that they have waffles and their coffee is good enough to drink black. The waffles are always perfectly light and crispy. My boyfriend usually orders off the daily specials board and is always happy with what he gets. 

We just had to order takeout while the dining room is closed and everything was packed perfectly, no gravy ended up where it didn't belong."
Baja Cafe on Campbell,"We came here to try something different and are now becoming fast regulars. The food and portions are excellent and I really enjoy the freshness and changing of the specials. There has not been a visit my family or myself have left disappointed. The waffles with mixed berries and mascarpone is one of, if not the best I've had. 

I would highly recommend. A word for wise if you visit on the weekend (especially Sunday) it gets very busy but well worth the wait."
Saguaro Corners Restaurant & Bar,The food is great... atmosphere is great. Especially out on the patio listening to Jay Faircloth.
Mi Nidito Restaurant,"Having grown up in Tucson, I've been going here for 30 plus years. I'm now living in Washington state, but every trip home includes a meal at our family's favorite Mexican restaurant. The frozen margaritas are to die for and the food is always great. My favorites include the #3 combo plate (with a beef taco, tamale, cheese enchilada and beans) and the carne seca plate. Be prepared to wait, this is the best there is!"
La Botana Tacos,"I'm deeply disappointed in myself for never visiting La Botana when I lived in Tucson--I even drove by it nearly every day! I was a dang fool. 

We came on a Friday afternoon (Black Friday) and it was pretty slow; we were one of only a few tables in there. Service was awesome though. Super quick and friendly, and checked back in with us frequently but not annoyingly. We had a couple of grande margaritas, since they are 2 for the price of 1 all day every day. I opted for the prickly pear, my favorite always, while boo thang went for the cucumber jalapeño. Both were great, though mine was a touch sweeter and heavier on the tequila. His was super tasty, not too spicy. I especially liked that both were rimmed with tajin instead of salt or sugar! And boy, oh boy, are they grande. 42oz of tequila-y goodness knocked me on my butt f

We were brought complimentary chips and bean dip, but there was also a salsa bar inside where you could grab some additional salsas. We didn't take advantage of that this time, but definitely will be sure to cruise by the next time we're in. I went for the surf and turf quesadilla, which was gargantuan and came with cilantro rice and pinto beans. Everything was really good, particularly the beans. The quesadilla was delightful, and generous with the carne asada and shrimp. It came in a giant flour tortilla that was wonderful and see-through (aka the best kind). My one tiny gripe was that it was just a touch salty--but with the rice and beans thrown on, that wasn't too much of a problem. I ended up having to take about half of it home. The dude got the torito tacos and raved and raved about them. He said it was one of the most unique plates he had ever had and wasn't quite sure what was going on, but he loved them. For the record, they were peppers stuffed with cheese and shrimp, wrapped in bacon, slapped on a taco. He highly recommended them. He's gluten intolerant, so it was awesome that they denote the gluten free options on their menu. 

We were way too stuffed for dessert this time around, but definitely will be back for more of those crazy huge margs and tasty tacos!"
Tacos Apson,"If I could eat here every day, I would. Tacos are my favorite food on the planet and Tacos Apson has the BEST in Tucson, maybe the world."
CharroVida,"I was very excited to try this new restaurant since I really enjoy plant based food. I have to say that it didn't not disappoint, it was much better than I expected. I went with my husband and we both ordered different things that way we could try more. We ordered the esquite as a started and the corn was so rich and deliciously creamy they paired it with their house made chips. (You definitely have to try this) I got the enchiladas, all 3 are very different from one another but are the perfect combination, he got the Tamales and it comes with two different kinds, a green and a red they were both the perfect consistency. I have to say that when I tried the red one it took me back to my childhood when I used to visit my aunt in Mexico City, it tasted just like the Oaxaca tamales I used to have at her house.  Now I will talk about desserts. We couldn't believed they were gluten free and vegan. I would definitely come back to try more of their menu items.  The place has such a good vibe, the servers are very nice and the ambience music is very comfortable."
Baja Cafe on Campbell,"This has become our favorite breakfast place in town. Amazing food, fast friendly service. 10/10 will return next time we are in Tucson."
Little Mexico,"Awesome service, they remember you and what drinks you like. Very authentic Mexican food. My only problem is one day the huevos rancheros were hot and 2 day later is was made with no heat because I am white I guess. I like the heat. But other than that it's super good food."
Mestizos,I want to start out by warning you that right now they are cash only! Which could be a set back for some people but in my case didn't set them back because we happened to be prepared. After a long day out in the Tucson mountains my family and I was very hungry and couldn't decide if we wanted chipotle or Panera (yes very basic) but then I decided that we should try something new and I had seen this place a few times driving by. So I suggested it and it was a hit! The place is quaint but cute if it's a nice day I vote you sit outside because it is super nice. When we got the menu it was small but they did have written that it was a temporary menu I'm not sure how long it's been that way though. Anyways the taco selection seemed good but I opted for breakfast which was machaca (not sure if I spelled that right) and egg. Lemme day I'm NOT a tortilla fan but these were some real good tortillas. The service was overall good besides the waitress did forget to put in part of our order but they fixed that really quick. The lady told us we should try their flan and so we did and I don't like flan (I'm picky oops) but this flan was good. I say that if you are in the area and choosing between basic chain restaurants or this definitely go for this you won't regret it!
CharroVida,"My wife has a super ridiculous restrictive diet.  It is extremely difficult to find a place to eat out where she can find something she can eat, much less enjoy.  We had been looking forward to an opportunity to try out  Charro Vida because we knew the story behind the owner's passion to open their concept.  We were so grateful to meet Chef, Nathan; Manager, Robert; Hostess, Trinity, and server, Farrah.  Each one, with friendly care explained and prepared a meal that we both genuinely enjoyed.  If you are looking for a place with delicious food and need to eat clean, you won't be disappointed!"
Tacos Apson,I have been coming here for years the absolute best tacos in Tucson don't even argue with me. Does not compare this is as authentic as it gets and the food is amazing
Saguaro Corners Restaurant & Bar,"Chef CJ Hamm makes meals from his heart. His passion for great food is to our benefit. Go and relax and enjoy great food and your favorite drink. 
Did you know Chef was on the tv series Chopped? 
We had the pulled pork hash and eggs and omelette on the weekend brunch menu. Enjoyed the pet friendly outdoor seating. 
Bon appetit"
CharroVida,"Amazing food and staff.  It is plant based but has everything you would want meat-wise as well.  Very fresh and healthy, awesome drinks and great atmosphere.  I got the summer song salad and added salmon and avocado - one of the best meals I have ever had.  Wife got the Caesar tostita salad with chicken and a mimosa and said the same.  Price? Coffee, mimosa, 2 apps (brussel sprouts and hummus), 2 meals....just under 50 bucks.  Can't beat that for high quality food."
La Fresita Tucson,"Soooo good and so reasonably priced!! So many options!! Their tortas are some of the best in town. Love the enchilada, taco y tamale combo special that's usually on the board. Great aguas frescas. Yummy desserts."
Barrio Charro,"Our first experience there was amazing! I ordered vegan Broadmoor Melt and my wife had Barrio historico tlayuda. Both were absolutely delicious! I was pleasantly surprised with the homemade chips that were fantastic, and their salsita is just OMG! We also asked if they were offering any vegan desserts and it turned out that their pudding is vegan until they pour caramel on top of it, which the cashier/host helped organized for us. Thank you for that! It was delightful.

I will come back 100%. I loved everything there, the food, the staff, the interior, the cleanliness. The only thing that was upsetting is one of the customers who was ignorant enough to not wear a mask inside the restaurant when placing an order and talking to a member of the staff."
Mi Nidito Restaurant,"The wait will be forever. Unless you go around 1:00am. But it's worth it. Good vegetarian choices. I loved the enchiladas with green sauce. And their cheese soup is amazing. Great choices for a vegetarian and the portions are HUGE. Drinks are mediocre, I've had better margaritas. But the food is worth it."
El Antojo Poblano,Everything I've tried here is the best Mexican food I've had outside of Mexico.    Outstanding food truck.
Street Taco And Beer,"Nice atmosphere, great food, cold beer, and free all you can eat chips/nachos with salsa! What else could you ask? Oh yeah, great prices.  One of my favorite casual spots to chill."
CharroVida,"Some of the best healthy dishes in Pima County. Great taste, always fresh ingredients, and good service. Best COVID-19 takeout!!!"
Mi Nidito Restaurant,"Well I've read the reviews and I always find it funny when people don't give a good review cause it wasn't what they expected. Or it was too bland. 
Service was great. Food was exactly what it was supposed to be. I would defiantly come back to try more dishes. I loved what I ordered. I got the ground beef tacos. 
I don't like spicy food so for those people who do, you can add the heat. You have to remember that those of us that don't like spicy food can't remove it once it's in there."
Baja Cafe on Campbell,"First time here and the food, and service is really good. It was a different eggs Benedict with Green Chile and poached eggs but quite good. My friend had their famous cinnamon pan cake - it is amazing. I hope their other branches have the same awesome service because the guy who served and recommended food was good."
Ruiz Hot Dogs,"Eye catching signage and welcoming staff greet you as you enter; I was only in Arizona for the MLK Jr. weekend and wanted to try the famed Sonoran Dog on our way to Saguaro National Park so I stopped in, great outdoor seating and delicious food. I would only make the elote just a touch more Parmesan-y Mayo-y spicy than sour -- growing up in LA, I love my street vendor style recipe! Loved the design and Cesar Chavez quote :)"
Baja Cafe on Campbell,"Breakfast restaurants are a special treat, so we always pick carefully so as to maximize the morning palette's pleasure. Well, this review is just another voice in the chorus of great reviews. Instead of focusing on the restaurant, I'll focus on the specific dishes I ordered - The Roadrunner #5 and Pineapple Express Pancake. 

First up: Roadrunner #5. This dish was delicious from the first bite to the last. It's one of the best vegetarian breakfast dishes I've ever had. It has a variety of savory flavors that compliment each other extremely well. The toppings were partitioned so I was able to choose from different segments of the dish. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked. The gooey yolks added to the mixed flavors on my fork. Super well done! 
The accompanying hash browns had the right amount of moisture and crispiness, and salted just so lightly to bring out the freshness of the shredded potatoes. 
Secondly... For 'dessert' I ordered the Pineapple Express Pancake . It was like a deep dish pancake with an explosion of fruit sweetness on top. The orange brown sugar butter gave a touch of saltiness to offset and balance the sweetness. I was only able to enjoy a few bites in my mouth since the main dish was so plentiful. I'm hoping I can pan heat this tomorrow morning to bring my stomach back to that happy place. 
The wait was about a half hour, but well worth it. Service was 4 of 5 stars. It wasn't for lack of attention as much as having to share our server with so many other tasks and tables. 
The only improvement I could suggest is to get a Yelp Waitlist going at this fine establishment. Oh, and to open one up in Phoenix, pretty please"
Tacos Apson,"Dear Tacos Apson,
Where have you been all my life? You are a meat lover's dream.  You are delicious.  I think... I think I... love you. There I said it.  I've been driving through Tucson for a number of years but never stopped and, well, now I have a reason just to GO to Tucson."
Mi Nidito Restaurant,I always get the flautas and they are honestly pretty fire. They have really good service and their piña colada is pretty good. I love it here.
Paco's,"I only wish they were open Sunday.   

The carne asada and carnitas burritos are just about perfect San Diego style with meat, pico and guacamole.   I'd love to check out the rest of the menu but then I have to have some more of that perfect crunchy carnitas.  

Paco's is an inexpensive place and doesn't have a salsa bar or anything like that but it's pretty great in all of it's Formica, fluorescent lights, and soccer on the TV glory."
Poco & Moms,"I know it is kinda crazy - but this is my go to place for delish breakfast! Yep. Breakfast! ALL DAY! I get the same thing all the time - bacon and eggs, hash browns, white toast (so yummy I wish I knew what brand it was) and a big side of gravy! They have some of THE BEST gravy in town (I want to lick the bowl)! Ok sometimes I get a half order of biscuits & gravy too... SO YUM! 

I get all may cravings out in one place because I LOVE their salsa too so I munch on chips & salsa before my breakfast comes.  

The chimis are good and the whatever the white green chili sauce is! *drool*
the stuffed sopapilla with what ever meat you want stuff in there - YUM! 
Great beans too! Sometimes I get a side of beans and mix in the salsa and eat it with my chips!

Yum, yum YUM! now I want to go eat there."
El Coronado,We started coming here by chance just trying to find something good just after they opened. The food is always amazing. The staff are friendly and attentive. Often you even get a visit to your table by one of the owners. It has become my favorite local Mexican place by far.
The Little One,"Stupendous molé, the staff are always hustling so the food gets to you fast and delicious. I read a few reviews stating that the music is too loud, pishaw. The food is loud and flavorful, the service is bright and warm, why wouldn't the music be boisterous and enjoyable? Oohhh btw......It's cash only, so stop across the street at your bank beforehand and bring your dinero to trade for plates of delicious satisfaction :)"
Seis Kitchen,"I don't normally write reviews but this place is too good not to!  Great food, and awesome environment!"
The Little One,"(Taste:5/Service:5/Experience:5/Dog Friendly Patio:Yes) If there was one restaurant that epitomizes Tucson for me this is it.  The food is absolutely tremendous, every time!  The food is so simple so fresh, perfectly spiced, I could go on.  Of the plates I've tried there's one I come back to and go figure it's the combination plate.  The combo plate has the choice of an additional entrée, me and the wife went for the ""mystery"" it was amazing. Just let them know it you want it chicken based, beef based etc.  What's new since last time we visited, in order for them to minimize food waste you have to request beans and tortillas on the si, makes since. And finally if for some bizarre reason you have left overs you have to bring your own Tupperware, different, but totally fits this culinary gem! I love it, the wife loves it, we'll be back!!"
The Little One,"Oh my god!! Loved this place. No sooner did I order than my food arrived. I had carne en chile verde- I was able to get the Large cup of it which was exactly enough for lunch without left overs. Oh and the SALSA!!!!!  I had an incredible meal, wonderful friendly service and under $7 - it's a must."
Seis Kitchen,"I thought Seis Kitchen was great! There was a SUPER long line, but ordering was simple and our food arrived faster than I thought. Everyone loved what they ordered. I recommend the veggie nachos!"
"Guadalajara Grill - Fiesta, Best Mexican Restaurant in Tucson","We walked in on a Sunday morning at 10:30 to be informed that the restaurant is only serving Brunch until 3 pm and the regular menu would be available then.  We walked out, started to call for a lyft to another location and the manager walked out and said he'd be more than happy to let us order off of the regular menu early!  Needless to say, the table made salsa is the greatest on the planet and the ultimate fajitas were more than enough for my lady and I!  Thank you so much to the hostess and our attentive and knowledgeable server for helping us!  Can't wait to come back again!"
El Taco Rico,Love this place they have catered two of my party's delicious I would say go visit these people best mexican food in town
Rigo's Restaurant,"The best time to go to Rigos is on Sundays. They always have a breakfast buffet and the price is right. The Buffet is small An consists of eggs with ham, chilaquilas, re fried beans, chorizo, machaca, menudo, pancakes, salsa, sausage links, fried potatoes and tortillas. It's a good authentic Mexican breakfast"
Los Betos,Best cook in the game! (Old dude in the hat and mustache like a Mexican Super Mario) Always on point fast fresh and delicious. Can't say enough good things. Try everything on the menu and order the Super Fries and large Horchata. Your Welcome!
The Little One,"This place just continues to blow my mind!! The best green corn Tamale, mouthwatering vegetarian stuffed green chil and tastebuds crazy chicken mole."
The Little One,"You might feel a bit confused walking into Little Poca Cosa: the music is loud, employees are hugging random customers, and the menus tend to change often. But once you settle in, you begin to fall in love. The service is outstanding and the food is out of this world. Make it a point to stop here for breakfast or lunch."
Seis Kitchen,"The AVOCODO TACOS are my favorite thing in all of Tucson! They are soooo good. Everything else ive tried on the Menu is good, too, but I keep going back to the avo tacos. Yum!"
Los Betos,Man this food is so good we got the Mexican bowl and tacos and supernaco and a kids meal its was so good
Poco & Moms,We have been to many Mexican restaurants around town for the past several years. And Poco & Mom's is our favorite! Hands down!  Even though we have close to an hour's drive to get there....it's well worth the trip! Great food and drinks! And very attentive and friendly staff! What more could you ask for?
Macayo's Mexican Kitchen,"I write yelp reviews of my negative and positive experience. I never thought that the places I write about it review them. However this restaurant apparently does. A manager replied to my yelp review and told me to reach out. So, I did. Both managers I spoke with through email was absolutely amazing. I was definitely not trying to score a free meal. I'm not even a fan of going out to eat very often. However they offered for all 7 of us that went to dinner. It was really amazing. We went tonight (Friday. March 31st) our waiter was absolutely amazing. One of the best waiters I've ever had. His name is Henry. Definitely ask for him! We had a few other courteous waitresses that checked on us too. I never got to meet the managers unforutatenly but if you read this, please know I appreciate your courtesy. The food was also 1000x times better, too. I will be coming back next time we're able to go out and are craving mexican food. We may have not paid for anything but I did still leave a generous tip! Well deserved.

Steak Cortez and chicken chimichanga are the way to go by the way."
The Little One,"AWESOME!!!! ALWAYS fresh, yummy, deliciousness! MUST try the Chipotle Pork Creama, the Try Three Entree (the chef picks three of the entree items, a salad, ranch style beans, and corn tortillas), or really anything on the menu!! The atmosphere is warm, the owners are friendly (and on hand at all times), and the staff is attentive! I'd give them 10 stars if I could!!!!!!!"
Los Betos,Love this little place for breakfast burritos.  Food is fast and hot.  Great flavors and salsa bar.  Best machaca burritos in Tucson.  Servers are friendly and handle both the walk in and drive through without missing a beat.
Seis Kitchen,"Seis has been one of our favorite restaurants since the first time we came about a year ago. The taco platter is our favorite and the meat is always so juicy and fresh and the flavor is amazing. We came here tonight at the last minute (right before closing) and Sasha made sure we were served and got our food perfectly, and fast. She was really kind and understanding and continued to service us and check on us 30+ minutes after closing. She was very personable, funny and accommodating! Can't wait to come back to this location!! Sasha is AMAZING!!!"
Rollies Mexican Patio,Really delicious rolled tacos. Didn't care too much for the desert but those Rollie's are where it's at! We will definitely be back for more!
Jack in the Box,"This Jack-in-the-Box is amazing. Went to Starbucks next-door and they didn't give me a Pupiccino and was mean to my dog, so my dog was sad and I went to Jack-in-the-Box and I asked for whip cream and they gave my dog a really big bowl of whip cream. Very friendly workers. Fast service. Awesome attitude!"
Cardenas Ranch Markets,"Grreat market, I wanted to know if the onions i bought there were recalled. I was waiting to do pulled pork. Susan from Cardenas got back to me fast with a good report. Thanks So much! ."
Seis Kitchen,"Best Aqua Fresca! Can't get enough of their horchata, pineapple cucumber and strawberry lemon. Great breakfast burritos."
Seis Kitchen,"I'm suspect of people gushing about reviews--I worry increasingly that people say stuff to be nice or might even be planted to raise ratings. I want to assure you, my motives are pure. 

My wife and I have been driving around CO, UT, AZ, and NM the last couple of weeks doing our best to find places that are out of the ordinary.  Seis Kitchen is such a place--located within an oasis courtyard behind a plain-looking facade of shops a few blocks west of the Santa Cruz River in Tucson. 

Gush: Best food of our 3000 mile trip: The Chorizo con Papas Tacos was one of the best things I've ever eaten."
Costa Vida,"My husband and I go to CV regularly. I absolutely love the salads. The cilantro lime dressing is truly the best. My husband usually gets the grilled steak burrito. The portions are huge so most of the time we are able to take leftovers to work for lunch the next day. As crazy as this sounds, having Vitamin water as a choice in the soda machine makes me happy!  Tres leches is amazing!  The staff on Broadway is fantastic. Justin and Lindsay were super polite and helpful. If you've never tried it, you should definitely check it out."
The Little One,"This restaurant is the bomb! It's is so fresh, healthy and delicious. Their pasole is so good and the huevos rancheros are delicious. They also have refreshing drinks with basil, mango and lime. They play good music and also give to charities around Tucson which is super nice and cool."
Rigo's Restaurant,Delicious!! Fast and friendly staff. The chicken enchiladas with sour cream sauce were some of the best I've had. The carne asada chimichanga was gargantuan!! Very tender and flavorful. Definitely will be going back
Seis Kitchen,"Wow, this place is amazing!! We had a fantastic meal here. Restaurants like this are the reason Tucson has its gastronomy designation. 

We got carry out and when I called the employee was very knowledgeable and helpful with our gluten allergy. Their website is a bit confusing- when you filter for GF, only one item shows up. But when I called, I was told most of the menu is in fact GF. Chips are made in a separate fryer and were light and delicious. The salsa and guacamole we ordered were fantastic. It can be scary trying a new restaurant as a celiac, but we had zero issues and really enjoyed our meal. 

My chicken tinga tacos were soooo good. So fresh and flavorful. The fresh corn tortillas really were fantastic. 

I can't say enough good things about our meal here. The food was ready when they said it would be, was packaged well with silverware and napkins. The portions were generous and a good value I feel."
Gentle Ben’s Brewery,Great food and atmosphere!  The service from the managers and staff was excellent. The manager Young was personable and helpful.  I will be a returning customer.
The Little One,"We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at here Little Cafe Poca Cosa! First of all, keep in  mind a few things: 1) Cash only 2) They're closed on weekends and holidays and 3) They don't have to go styrofoam containers but instead sell you their restaurant's own reusable containers to take home leftovers and bring back each visit. So, be sure to plan ahead and remember to bring those containers if this is a repeat visit!

For my order, I first asked the waitress what non-vegetarian dish would be the least spicy, and she recommended the barbacoa de res (sirloin tip with mild green chiles, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and cilantro). It was fantastic... tasty, well-cooked, and a perfect mix of meat along with sides of salad and fruit. The meal was especially great when paired with the corn tortillas they gave our table. Side note: In the beginning, our waitress only gave us one pan of tortillas for our whole table, but after requesting more, she happily gave us another since there were 3 of us. My bf had the pollo en mole negro, which he enjoyed as well, and his mom ordered her consistently favorite dish, the cochinito en crema de chipotle (pork with spicy chipotle sauce). 

5 stars for a delicious lunch, and I look forward to coming here again!"
Seis Kitchen,"This is probably one of my favorite spots in Tucson. It's in the Mercado downtown next to the cute bakery and coffee shop and I'm so happy to have found this place! Every time we visit tucson, this is a MUST for lunch as they have great outdoor seating. I usually order nachos grande to start and finish off with some street tacos (*adobe steak is my favorite)."
The Little One,"At this place you know you exactly what you are getting: delicious food, loud music, yummy choices, extremely fast service, fair prices, friendly staff, and don't forget that hug at the end!  Came here for the first time with a friend and I was not disappointed.  Whatever they are doing, they are doing it right.  Keep it up"
